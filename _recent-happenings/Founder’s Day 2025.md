<h1>Celebrating 95 Years of our IJ Legacy</h1>
<p>This year’s Founder’s Day on 30 May 2025 was especially meaningful as
we marked our school’s 95th anniversary - a time of gratitude, reflection
and renewed commitment to the legacy of our founder, Blessed Nicolas Barré.</p>
<p>The celebration opened with a poignant presentation on Blessed Nicolas
Barré’s life, highlighting his unwavering dedication to educating the poor
and marginalised. His vision continues to guide us as we strive to be <strong><em>Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Adding a personal touch, several staff members, proud IJ alumnae, returned
in their old convent uniforms, rekindling school memories and the enduring
IJ sisterhood. Mrs Irene Lim and Mrs Pauline Tan shared heartfelt reflections
on how IJ virtues have shaped their lives and inspired their journeys as
IJ educators.</p>
<p>To involve every student meaningfully, hands-on activities centred on
this year’s theme <strong><em>Love Never Fails</em></strong> were held across
levels. P1–P3 girls folded origami hearts as symbols of kindness. P4–P6
girls created bracelets with words like <em>love</em>, <em>peace</em>, and <em>joy</em> -
daily reminders of the values we hold dear.</p>
<p>Founder’s Day was not only a tribute to our rich heritage, but also a
celebration of our vision: <strong>From Girls to Women of Grace and Substance</strong>.
Rooted in faith and love, may we at CHIJ (Katong) Primary continue nurturing
hearts and minds, confident that indeed <strong><em>Love Never Fails</em></strong>.</p>

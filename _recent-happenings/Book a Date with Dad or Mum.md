<p>Our school was filled with excitement and laughter during our ‘Book-A-Date
with Dad or</p>
<p>Mum’ on Wednesday, 7 May 2025. Students and parents came dressed as their
favorite</p>
<p>storybook characters, coming together to celebrate reading and creativity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event kicked off with fun literacy games, including ‘Book Bingo’ and
Story Dice</p>
<p>where families created their own imaginative tales. Parents and children
shared quality</p>
<p>time reading together and enjoying a delightful picnic in the school hall,
surrounded by</p>
<p>stories and smiles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the highlights of the day was our lively Character Parade, where
families proudly</p>
<p>showcased their costumes. The school was filled with a burst of colour
and imagination</p>
<p>as everyone marched to celebrate their favorite literary heroes and heroines.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event concluded with a prize ceremony, where the five best-dressed
parent-and-</p>
<p>child pairs were awarded for their creativity and spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to all the families who joined us and made this event a wonderful
success.</p>
<p>We look forward to many more magical moments where stories come alive
and families</p>
<p>celebrate learning together!</p>

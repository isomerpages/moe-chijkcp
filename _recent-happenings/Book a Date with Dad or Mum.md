<p>Our school was filled with excitement and laughter during our ‘Book-A-Date
with Dad or Mum’ on Wednesday, 7 May 2025. Students and parents came dressed
as their favorite storybook characters, coming together to celebrate reading
and creativity.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with fun literacy games, including ‘Book Bingo’ and
Story Dice where families created their own imaginative tales. Parents
and children shared quality time reading together and enjoying a delightful
picnic in the school hall, surrounded by stories and smiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the day was our lively Character Parade, where
families proudly showcased their costumes. The school was filled with a
burst of colour and imagination as everyone marched to celebrate their
favorite literary heroes and heroines.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a prize ceremony, where the five best-dressed
parent-and-child pairs were awarded for their creativity and spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to all the families who joined us and made this event a wonderful
success. We look forward to many more magical moments where stories come
alive and families celebrate learning together!</p>

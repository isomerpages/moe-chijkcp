<p>Our newly renovated Spice Garden has been transformed into the Living
Classroom—a vibrant and inviting space designed to spark curiosity and
joy in learning. Pupils are encouraged to explore three delightful zones:
The Fairy Flutter, The Whimsy Wood, and The Hungry Caterpillar, each offering
unique opportunities for discovery.</p>
<p>Within this Living Classroom, students are immersed in the garden’s natural
surroundings, where hands-on experiences bring learning to life. As they
observe, explore, and care for the flora and fauna, students develop a
deeper understanding of plant systems and the natural world around them.</p>
<p>Through experiential and inquiry-based learning, the garden nurtures a
sense of wonder, encourages respect for nature, and inspires a lasting
love for science and discovery.</p>

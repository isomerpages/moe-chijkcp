<h2><strong>Brownies Adventure Camp </strong></h2>
<p>Over the September holidays, our P3 to P5 Brownies enjoyed a fun-filled
2-day camp right here in school!</p>
<p>The girls worked together to earn several Brownie badges, including Entertainer,
Craft, and Toymaker. For many P3 and P4 girls, it was also their first
experience working towards the First Aider and Dental badges – and what
an adventure it was!</p>
<p>As part of the First Aider badge, they learned how to stop bleeding from
minor cuts and practiced making arm slings using triangular bandages—or
even their own scarves! Laughter and teamwork filled the room as they tried
out their new skills on one another.</p>
<p>Although the girls were a little disappointed they couldn’t head to East
Coast Park for the plogging activity due to inclement weather, they kept
their spirits high with energetic games like Captain’s Ball, Badminton,
and a lively Hula Hoop competition.</p>
<p>Before bedtime, each pack showcased a performance—be it a skit, song,
or dance—bringing joy and plenty of laughter to the night.</p>
<p>A highlight of the camp was the indoor campfire. Using LED tealights and
creative mini bonfires, the library was transformed into a warm, glowing
space that captured the magic of a real campfire.</p>
<p>On the final day, prizes were awarded to celebrate the girls’ creativity
and teamwork, with awards for Best Bonfire, Best Pack, and the coveted
title of Best Camper!</p>
<p>Throughout the camp, the girls had a wonderful time learning, laughing,
and bonding under the guidance of Mrs Fernandez and Mrs Faizal, whose dedication
made the experience even more meaningful. With so many memorable moments,
the Brownies truly grew together in spirit and friendship.</p>

<h1>CHIJ Primary's Medan Cultural Immersion Journey 2025</h1>
<p>From 22-25 April 2025, our students embarked on an enriching four-day
cultural immersion trip to Medan, Indonesia. Upon arrival at Kualanamu
International Airport, they were warmly welcomed with a traditional Batak
ceremony, their first taste of North Sumatran hospitality.</p>
<p>At Kalam Kudus Primary School, our students were once again greeted with
traditional Batak dances and music, setting the stage for two days of meaningful
cultural exchange. They participated in collaborative lessons, from traditional
craft-making to local cooking demonstrations, fostering friendships with
their Indonesian peers.</p>
<p>The journey continued with hands-on experiences at various cultural sites.
After an eye-opening visit to the Rahmat International Wildlife Museum
&amp; Gallery where students learned about wildlife conservation, they
tried their hands at rice planting in the verdant rice fields, learned
about sustainable farming at the hydroponic gardens, and enjoyed berry
picking at the fruit plantation. A scenic cruise on Lake Toba led them
to the Batak Cultural Village, where they discovered the rich heritage
of the indigenous Batak people.</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, we saw them grow in ways that words can hardly capture.
They were reflective, thoughtful, and always willing to learn. After each
debrief session, it was clear how much they were taking in â€” and even more
special was watching them make a conscious effort to change, to do better,
and to support one another.</p>
<p>They stepped out of their comfort zones with courage, looked out for each
other, and found ways to complement one another's strengths and needs.
They showed kindness in small, quiet moments and resilience when things
got a little tough. It was beautiful to watch new friendships form and
existing ones deepen.</p>
<p>This immersion experience has undoubtedly planted seeds of cultural appreciation
and personal growth that will continue to flourish in our students' hearts.</p>

<h2>Beginning of Year Mass 2026</h2>
<p>We celebrated our Beginning-of-Year Mass on Friday, 9 January 2026. We
thank Father Adrian Yeo from Holy Family Church for presiding and for guiding
our school community as we entrusted the year ahead to God’s loving care.
May our students and staff continue to grow in faith, wisdom and love throughout
the year.</p>

<h2>P5 Camp</h2>
<p>The P5 camp at MOE Labrador Outdoor Adventure Centre (23-25 January 2025)
was an unforgettable experience filled with laughter, learning, and growth.
The students had a blast, engaging in fun activities and picking up new
cheers that added to the excitement.</p>
<p>Through thoughtfully planned activities, the students learned self-reliance,
teamwork, and the impact of their decisions on themselves and others. They
also developed practical skills like basic navigation and outdoor packing,
with safety awareness emphasized throughout.</p>
<p>A campfire performance highlighted students’ creativity and team spirit,
while trainers went above and beyond to support the students. Teachers
also had the chance to bond with the students and each other. Special thanks
to the parents for trusting us with their children’s enriching experience.</p>
<p>Though the camp has ended, the memories, skills, and friendships will
last. It was a truly rewarding experience for all.</p>

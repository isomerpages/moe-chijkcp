<h2>Gift of Love</h2>
<p>In 2025, our school continued the Gift of Love project by collecting food
and household items for the Families in Need (FINs) supported by the Society
of St Vincent de Paul (SSVP), Church of the Holy Family.
<br>
<br>The project was made possible through generous donations from our school
community. Our parent volunteers helped to sort and pack the items, assisted
in delivering the donations to the church.
<br>
<br>While some teachers, parents, and students also took the extra step to
bring the items directly to the homes of the beneficiaries, spreading love
and hope to those in need.</p>

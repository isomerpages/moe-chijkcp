<h2><strong>95 Years as one KC Family! 45 Years moving forward as a KCSAA!</strong></h2>
<p>Our KC family gathered for a very special milestone – our&nbsp;<strong>95th Anniversary Lunch</strong>,
celebrating&nbsp;<em>95 Years as one KC Family</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>45 Years moving forward as a KCSAA</em>.</p>
<p>From the moment our guests arrived, the school was filled with joy and
nostalgia. Alumnae and friends were welcomed at the reception before heading
off on <strong>school tours</strong> featuring a “memory lane” of photos
and memorabilia.</p>
<p>In the MPH, a&nbsp;<strong>video montage</strong>&nbsp;tracing 95 years
of KC stories set the tone for the celebration. &nbsp;Guests enjoyed a
beautifully set&nbsp;<strong>buffet lunch</strong>, complete with blue-and-white
décor and fresh floral centrepieces, and thoughtful hall decorations.</p>
<p>The programme was filled with KC spirit – a moving&nbsp;<strong>handbell ensemble performance of “A Million Dreams”</strong>,
interactive&nbsp;<strong>table games</strong>&nbsp;with prizes, a fun&nbsp;<strong>photo booth</strong>&nbsp;and
a much-anticipated&nbsp;<strong>lucky draw</strong>.</p>
<p>We ended on a high – singing the&nbsp;<strong>school songs of both schools</strong>&nbsp;together,
celebrating generations of faith, friendship and service.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thanks to our staff, students, KCSAA and alumnae for making
this celebration possible, and to every KC girl and friend who returned
to honour our theme:
<br><strong>“95 Years as one KC Family! 45 Years moving forward as a KCSAA!”</strong>
</p>
<p>Here’s to many more years of shared memories ahead.</p>

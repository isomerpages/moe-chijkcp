<h2><strong>P6 Graduation Party 2025: <em>Dream Big, Fly High</em></strong></h2>
<p>On Friday, 7 November 2025, the school hall was magically transformed
into a stunning ballroom, reflecting the spirit of calm confidence and
limitless possibilities. Balloons, lights, and elegant décor created an
atmosphere of excitement and pride as the Primary 6 girls gathered for
their long-awaited Graduation Party.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, “<strong>Dream Big, Fly High</strong>,” inspired the
girls to set bold goals and pursue them with determination and courage.
It captured the spirit of ambition and the belief that with perseverance,
every dream is within reach.</p>
<p>The celebration began with an inspiring uplifting address by Mrs Mischa
Simon, who encouraged the girls to take pride in how far they had come
— of their successes, friendships, lessons learnt shaped them.</p>
<p>The afternoon was filled with joy and laughter through table games, class
performances, a photo booth, and a delicious buffet. Cheers rang during
the award presentations which recognised students for their kindness, cheerfulness
and school spirit with titles such as Miss IJ, Best Dressed, and class
awards such as Miss Helpful, Miss Tenderheart, and Miss Funshine.</p>
<p>As music, laughter, and heartfelt goodbyes filled the air, the event became
more than just a farewell — it was a celebration of growth, courage, and
sisterhood. The P6 Class of 2025 left the hall with cherished memories
and hearts to dream big and fly high into the next chapter of their lives.</p>

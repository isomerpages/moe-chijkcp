<h2>CHIJ (Katong) Primary Ushers in the Year of the Snake with Vibrant Celebrations!</h2>
<p>Our school hall buzzed with excitement as we welcomed the Year of the
Snake in style! The celebration kicked off with a mesmerising guzheng performance
of '喜洋洋', setting a joyous tone for the day.</p>
<p>Students were treated to a cultural extravaganza, featuring a captivating
lion dance by NTU performers, impressive wushu demonstrations, and delightful
dance routines. The air was filled with laughter during our interactive
games, including the hilarious blindfolded '画蛇添足' and a creative Chinese
character-forming challenge.</p>
<p>A highlight was the adorable performances by our Primary 1 and 2 students,
'萌宝过大年' and '新年快乐谣', which had everyone smiling. The celebration also included
a thoughtful skit, '今天是大年初一', bringing traditional customs to life.</p>
<p>The event culminated in a heartwarming gesture as students presented oranges
to their teachers, embodying the spirit of respect and gratitude. It was
truly a morning of cultural immersion, learning, and festive cheer!</p>

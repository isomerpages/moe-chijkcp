<p>The Joy of Learning Science truly comes alive at CHIJ (Katong ) Primary.
Pupils collaborate in groups to conduct out hands-on experiments, turning
curiosity into discovery as they explore, discuss, and learn together.
Using all five senses, they make careful observations, investigate actively,
and draw meaningful connections to the world around them.</p>
<p>Lively conversations, shared ideas, and thoughtful questions create a
dynamic environment, making communication a key part of every learning
experience. Through teamwork and engaging exploration, pupils build scientific
understanding while developing confidence, curiosity, and a genuine love
for learning Science.</p>

<h2><strong>PE Monitorsâ€™ Learning Journey to the World Aquatics Championship with Sunlove AAC Seniors</strong></h2>
<p>Our PE monitors embarked on a meaningful learning journey to the World
Aquatics Championship Experience Zone, where they had the special opportunity
to interact with seniors from Sunlove Active Ageing Centre (AAC).</p>
<p>The session kicked off with a warm welcome and a series of adaptive games
designed to promote inclusivity, teamwork, and fun. Our students paired
up with the seniors, guiding them through the activities and ensuring everyone
felt engaged and supported. It was heartwarming to witness both the students
and seniors looking out for one another as they shared laughter and encouragement
throughout the morning.</p>
<p>After the games, the group explored the various interactive booths at
the Experience Zone. From hands-on exhibits to informative displays, students
and seniors learned more about aquatic sports and the spirit of the championship
together.</p>
<p>The event culminated in a joyful moment as everyone joined in the Dance
of the Nation, celebrating unity, movement, and shared joy through dance.</p>
<p>This intergenerational experience was not only enjoyable but also deeply
enriching. We hope the girls and the seniors had a fruitful and meaningful
time, building new connections and learning through shared experiences
in sports.</p>

<h2>Thanksgiving Mass 2025</h2>
<p>On 17 November 2025, our school gathered as one IJ family to celebrate
Thanksgiving Mass and mark the close of a meaningful school year. Celebrated
by Father Venus, the Mass was filled with his warm presence and gentle
humour, bringing comfort and joy to students, staff, and parents.</p>
<p>Guided by our 2025 theme, Love Never Fails, we reflected on God’s steadfast
love present in our friendships, learning, joys, and even the challenges
that helped us grow.</p>
<p>In his homily, Father Venus reminded us that November is the month of
All Saints and encouraged us to follow in the footsteps of the Saints by
choosing goodness, courage, and love each day. He emphasised that sainthood
is not about perfection but about bringing Christ’s love into the world
through compassion, forgiveness, gratitude, and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the Gospel of the ten lepers, he invited us to be like the
one who returned to thank Jesus, always remembering to pause, acknowledge
and give thanks.</p>
<p>The Mass concluded with prayers of gratitude for the year that has passed
and blessings for the year ahead. As we end the school year, we give thanks
for all the blessings, lessons, and moments that shaped us, and we seek
God’s guidance as we continue to grow in love, unity, and compassion.</p>
<p>May we enter the new year renewed in spirit, ready to love as Christ loves
us because Love Never Fails.</p>

<h3><strong>Threads: The Emperor’s New Clothes Musical</strong></h3>
<p>On 15 April, our Primary One students embarked on an exciting Arts learning
journey to watch Threads: The Emperor’s New Clothes, a delightful musical
currently showing at the Singapore Repertory Theatre.</p>
<p>The experience was nothing short of enchanting! From the moment the curtains
rose, our students were captivated by the vibrant costumes, catchy songs,
and humorous storytelling. This fresh take on the classic tale highlighted
important values like honesty, kindness, and self-expression, brought to
life through engaging performances and a colourful stage set.</p>
<p>Interactive segments allowed students to sing along and respond to the
characters and involved, while witty dialogue kept them entertained throughout.
This meaningful learning journey gave them a chance to enjoy the performing
arts, explore musical storytelling, and reflect on the lessons shared —
all while having a great time! It was heartwarming to see their faces light
up with joy and excitement!</p>

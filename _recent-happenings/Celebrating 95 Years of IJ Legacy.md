<h1><strong>A Joyous Thanksgiving Mass</strong></h1>
<p>On 27 May 2025, CHIJ (Katong) Primary and CHIJ Katong Convent, affectionately
known as the Convent by the sea, came together to celebrate a remarkable
milestone - 95 years of faith, love and service. The joint 95th Anniversary
Mass was held at the Church of the Holy Family.</p>
<p>Our Thanksgiving Mass was graced by distinguished guests, including Sister
Elizabeth, Sister Maria, members of the IJ Board, principals of fellow
IJ schools and former principals from both the primary and secondary schools.
Parents and students from both schools filled the pews, united in spirit
and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The Mass, celebrated by Father Adrian, Father Venus, and Father Robertus,
was both solemn and uplifting. In his homily, Father Adrian reflected on
the theme of the celebration, “Love Never Fails” drawing from the moving
reading from 1 Corinthians 13. He reminded all present of the kind of love
Jesus calls us to - patient, kind, enduring, and selfless. He encouraged
the IJ community to live out this love through our daily actions, and to
be beacons of God’s love to those around us. The message resonated deeply
with the IJ mission and charism, reminding everyone that our work and journey
in CHIJ are rooted in love and service.</p>
<p>A deeply moving moment came at the close of the celebration when students
from both schools stood together to sing the IJ Spirit and Hold On to Our
Dream. Their heartfelt singing filled the church with emotion and unity,
bringing some in the congregation to tears. It was a beautiful expression
of the true blue IJ spirit - full of love, hope, joy and shared purpose.</p>
<p>As we reflect on 95 years of HIS blessings, may we continue to walk forward
in faith, with courage and compassion, holding fast to the truth that Love
Never Fails.</p>

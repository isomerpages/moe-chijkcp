<h2>Price Giving Ceremony 2025</h2>
<p>The Annual Prize-Giving Ceremony at CHIJ (Katong) Primary took place on
19 November 2025, filling the Multi-Purpose Hall with excitement and anticipation.
Parents, staff, students, and honoured guests gathered to celebrate the
outstanding achievements of our girls across school virtues, academics,
sports, and co-curricular activities.</p>
<p>Awards were presented to students who demonstrated excellence in various
domains. School Virtues Awards were given to one student per class from
P3 to P6 for exemplifying the four IJ virtues. Academic Excellence Awards
recognised the top performers at each level, alongside subject-specific
awards for exceptional achievement. Special School Awards were also presented
to selected P6 students for all-rounded excellence, character, the arts,
and service. Many others were acknowledged for their strong performances
in CCAs such as Swimming, Track and Field, Bowling, Brownies, and more.
Together, these accomplishments reflect the dedication, talent, and perseverance
our students have shown throughout the year.</p>
<p>Our Guest-of-Honour, Ms Vivienne Lim, Chairperson of the CHIJ Board of
Management, delivered an inspiring message centred on the transformative
power of love. She emphasised three key aspects: love as an anchor, which
grounds us in our identity and values; love as service, expressed through
kindness, compassion, and care for others; and love as a catalyst for growth,
motivating us to learn, persevere, and give our best. Her message beautifully
captured the IJ mission and reminded our girls that love is a daily choice
that shapes who we become.</p>
<p>Our Principal, Mrs Mischa Simon, echoed this in her address, highlighting
our school theme for the year – “Love Never Fails.” It was a meaningful
coincidence that both speeches centred on love, reinforcing how this virtue
underpins our IJ spirit and strengthens our community.</p>
<p>The evening was a heartfelt celebration of the potential, resilience,
and achievements of our girls. As we honour their accomplishments, we also
look forward to the many ways they will continue to grow, serve, and shine.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award recipients!</p>

<h1><strong>P4, P5 &amp; P6 Catholic Students Retreat: Spiritual Formation – Strong As One</strong></h1>
<p>Our P4, P5 and P6 Catholic students recently took part in a meaningful
retreat themed <strong><em>Strong As One</em></strong>, designed to nurture
both faith and unity. Through prayer, reflection and shared experience,
students were reminded that they walk with God and with one another - never
alone.</p>
<p>Our students visited sacred spaces central to our Catholic tradition:
P4 at St. Peter and Paul Church, P5 at the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd
and P6 at St. Joseph Church. These visits helped them connect with the
living history of the Church and their place within it.</p>
<p>A key focus was developing a living prayer life. Guided prayer, quiet
reflection and for many P4 and P5 students, their first experience to the
Adoration Room offered powerful moments of stillness and encounter with
Christ. These experiences strengthened their understanding of prayer as
a relationship with God.</p>
<p>This retreat was an important step in our students’ faith journey deepening
belief, fostering belonging and celebrating community. As Scripture reminds
us, <strong><em>“For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them”</em> </strong>(Matthew
18:20).</p>

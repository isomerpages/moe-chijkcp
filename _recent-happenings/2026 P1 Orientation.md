<p>On 2 January, we welcomed our Primary 1 cohort of 2026. The girls arrived
brimming with energy and enthusiasm as they gathered in the school hall,
standing tall and proud to sing the National Anthem and recite the Pledge
for the first time as primary school students.</p>
<p>While the students were meaningfully engaged in classroom bonding activities
and getting to know their new teachers and classmates, parents attended
informative sessions on Student Development, ICT, and curriculum matters.
This was followed by a guided school tour, which offered parents a glimpse
into their daughters’ new learning environment.</p>
<p>The morning concluded with a Parent–Teacher Meeting, providing families
with the opportunity to connect with their respective Form Teachers. As
the day drew to a close, the smiles on the faces of both students and parents
were a heart-warming sight. It was truly a fulfilling first day, and we
look forward to many more joyful days of learning and growth ahead.</p>

<p>As part of the school’s commitment to providing a holistic education and
to nurturing socially responsible, caring, and empathetic students, we
have implemented the <strong>Primary 1 and Primary 4: I Can Be A Pal – Buddy Programme</strong>.
This programme provides meaningful opportunities for our Primary 4 students
to learn beyond the curriculum.</p>
<p>To help orientate our new Primary 1 students and support their smooth
assimilation into the school culture, the Primary 4 students will serve
as buddies to the 2026 cohort of Primary 1 students. The programme supports
Primary 1 students in learning daily school routines, while helping Primary
4 students grow in responsibility and empathy.</p>

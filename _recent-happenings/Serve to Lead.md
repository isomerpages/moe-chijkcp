<h2>Bridging Generations Through Sport</h2>
<p>During the March Holidays, our PE monitors had the unique opportunity
to participate in the Serve to Lead programme—an initiative designed to
foster intergenerational bonding through sports. In collaboration with
SportSG and Sunlove Chai Chee Active Ageing Centre (AAC), our school welcomed
30 elderly participants for a morning of fun, connection, and active living.</p>
<p>Students and seniors played and bonded together, fostering joy and teamwork
through games such as Seated Volleyball, Standing Captain’s Ball, and Bean
Bag Tic-Tac-Toe. This meaningful experience not only allowed our students
to serve the community but also deepened their appreciation for active
ageing and the importance of inclusivity in sport.</p>

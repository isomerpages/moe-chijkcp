<p>Our school commemorated International Friendship Day on 9 April with the
theme <em>"</em><strong><em>Forging Friendships in a Complex World.</em></strong><em>"</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students had the opportunity to deepen their understanding of regional
cultures by exploring ASEAN’s rich and diverse food cultures and gained
valuable insights into the region's cultural heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students had the opportunity to deepen their understanding of regional
cultures by learning about the rich and diverse food cultures of ASEAN
countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An extended one-hour recess was specially planned to allow students
embarked on a delicious journey through ASEAN's vibrant food cultures.
They explored a variety of interactive food-themed stations, each manned
by our Parent Volunteers who brought these experiences to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the Vietnam station, students selected a variety of spices to
create their own spice sachets to bring home. Students were tested on their
knowledge of Filipino cuisine at the Philippines station by matching the
names of popular dishes to their corresponding images. They were taught
simple greetings and useful phrases in the respective ASEAN languages,
including how to order food – enhancing their appreciation for both the
language and culture of each country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students participated in an engaging and interactive "Scent and
Touch" game. They used their senses to identify Thai herbs and spices and
matched each spice to a corresponding Thai dish. Through this hands-on
activity, students learned about essential ingredients commonly used in
Thai cuisine. They discovered that lemongrass is a key aromatic in Tom
Yum Goong, galangal gives Tom Kha Gai its unique flavor, and kaffir lime
leaves add a citrusy aroma to Panang Curry.</p>

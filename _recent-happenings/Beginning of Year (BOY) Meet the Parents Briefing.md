<h4><strong>A Strong Start to 2026: Fostering Partnerships at the Beginning-of-Year (BOY) Meet the Parents Briefing</strong></h4>
<p>The 2026 school year is off to a wonderful start! We were delighted to
welcome our parents to the Beginning-of-Year Meet the Parents Briefing<strong>, </strong>held
on 16 January for Primary 5 and 6 parents, and 23 January for Primary 2
to 4 parents.</p>
<p>The sessions began with an address by our Principal, Mrs. Simon. She highlighted
the school’s vision for the year ahead, reiterating the school’s commitment
to the holistic development of every girl. Mrs. Simon particularly emphasised
the vital role of the home-school partnership, encouraging parents to maintain
open, regular conversations with their daughters to support their growth
and well-being.</p>
<p>Following the Principal’s address, parents proceeded to the classrooms
to meet their daughters' Form Teachers. This provided our parents an opportunity
to step into their child's learning environment, build rapport with the
form teachers, and gain a clearer understanding of the classroom expectations
and goals set for the year.</p>
<p>We look forward to a meaningful and fruitful partnership with all our
parents in 2026. Together, we are strong as one!</p>

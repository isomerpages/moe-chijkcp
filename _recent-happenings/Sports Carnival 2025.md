<h1>Sports Carnival 2025 Highlights!</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Our annual Sports Carnival was held on 4 April 2025 at Temasek Polytechnic,
and what an exciting day it was!</p>
<p>P3–P6 students, along with their enthusiastic parents, came together for
a day filled with fun, games, and friendly competition. One of the highlights
was the Fathers’ and Mothers’ Races – the response was so overwhelming
that we had to ballot for the final 40 participants in each race!</p>
<p>The girls showcased their energy and teamwork in the inter-house relay
races, Captain’s Ball matches, and various game stations. We were also
blessed with cool, pleasant weather for most of the event, which made it
even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all the parents who made time to join us and be
present for their daughters’ school event — your support truly made a difference.
A special shoutout as well to the 30 amazing Parent Volunteers who helped
man the game stations for our P3 and P4 students. We couldn’t have done
it without you!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who came down and made this carnival a truly memorable
one!</p>

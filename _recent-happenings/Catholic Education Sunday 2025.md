<h1>Catholic Education Sunday </h1>
<p>Catholic Education Sunday (CES) was observed&nbsp;last weekend, 23 and
24 August 2025 at all Catholic&nbsp;parishes in Singapore. 12 of our students,
accompanied by the teachers of the school Chaplaincy team, attended the
5.30 p.m. mass at Holy Family Church in Katong.</p>
<p>The students greeted the parishioners and distributed specially printed
CES cards, served during mass as lectors, brought up the offertory to the
priest, assisted the hospitality ministers and wardens with the mass collection
and one student shared with the congregation why she enjoys being in a
Catholic school.</p>
<p>Catholic schools have a long and rich history in Singapore. We pray that
this continues into the future.</p>

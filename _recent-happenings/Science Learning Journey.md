<p>Our Primary 6 students enjoyed a meaningful Science Learning Journey to
the Science Centre Singapore, where science came alive beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>During a hands-on workshop, students learnt about Newton’s Laws of Motion
and applied their knowledge by designing, building, and launching their
own rockets. Seeing their rockets soar helped them better understand how
forces work together in real-life situations.</p>
<p>Students also explored the Centre’s interactive exhibits, discovering
how science connects to everyday life. This learning highlighted the value
of experiential learning beyond textbooks, making science engaging, memorable,
and fun.</p>
<p>It was a rewarding experience that sparked curiosity and deepened students’
appreciation for science.</p>

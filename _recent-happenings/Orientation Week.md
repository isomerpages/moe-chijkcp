<h1><strong>Strong as One: A Joyful Start into the IJ KCP Family</strong></h1>
<p>Our first week of school orientation warmly welcomed students into the
IJ KCP family under the theme <strong>Strong as One</strong>. The week was
filled with laughter, engaging games and meaningful bonding activities
that helped students connect with one another and feel a strong sense of
belonging.</p>
<p>Carefully crafted lesson packages introduced school programmes, routines
and expectations in purposeful and student-friendly ways while whole-cohort
talks brought everyone together to shared values and set a positive direction
for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Inspired by our founder, Nicolas Barré, who reminds us to <em>“Do all the good you can,”</em> students
were encouraged to care for one another, work collaboratively and grow
as one united IJ family. Through shared experiences and collaboration,
the spirit of being <strong>Strong as One</strong> came alive across the
cohort.</p>
<p>As friendships began to form and confidence grew, the foundation for the
year was firmly set. At IJ KCP, we believe that <em>IJ friends are friends for life</em>,
and this orientation week marked the beginning of many meaningful friendships
and shared journeys ahead.</p>

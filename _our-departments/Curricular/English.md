<h2>English</h2>
<p>CHIJ (Katong) Primary uses both STELLAR (the national English Language
curriculum) and our school-based curriculum to achieve the outcomes specified
by MOE’s English Language Syllabus.</p>
<p>The English Language Syllabus focuses on the development, reinforcement,
and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment
of the language and the promotion of extensive reading, leveraging on listening,
oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent
use of the language.</p>
<h4><strong>STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading)</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture children who love reading and have a strong foundation in the
English Language, the school uses the STELLAR approach. Through the use
of STELLAR, we strengthen their language and reading skills as well as
promote a positive attitude towards learning. The programme uses research-based
teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in
the learning of English.</p>
<p>We aim to develop effective and affective language use in students in
the following ways:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listen to, read, and view critically and with accuracy, understanding
and appreciating a wide array of literary and informational texts in Standard
English from print, non-print and digital networked sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak, write, and represent in Standard English that is grammatical, fluent,
intelligible and appropriate for different purposes, audiences, contexts
and cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately,
and understand how speakers/writers put words together and use language
to communicate meaning and achieve impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use English with impact, effect and affect.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>School-based curriculum</h4>
<p>To build a strong foundation and rich language for all, we use a variety
of print and non-print resources, as we broaden our students’ language
exposure and learning experiences so that they will develop an appreciation
for the use of language in various contexts according to the purpose, audience
and culture. We continuously strive to enhance our teaching to enrich learning
for our students, and we carry out our school-based curriculum and Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) to complement STELLAR.</p>
<h4>Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>Over the years, students will have opportunities to go on several learning
journeys. This enables students to learn beyond the classroom, engaging
in hands-on and real-life experiences, e.g. watching a play, visiting Gardens
by the Bay, Asian Civilisations Museum and the Singapore Zoological Gardens.</p>
<h4>Joy of Learning</h4>
<p>Teachers strive to make lessons interesting for students by making lessons
Relevant, Applicable and Personal.</p>

<h4>Literacy Support Programmes</h4>
<p>We have various literacy programmes to cater to girls who require additional
support. These include Learning Support Programme (LSP - P1 &amp; P2),
Reading Remediation Programme (RRP - P3 &amp; P4) and School-based Dyslexia
Remediation (SDR - P3 &amp; P4). These programmes are conducted by trained
teachers who are equipped with skills to provide the necessary remediation
for reading through comprehensive teaching packages and guidelines developed
by the Reading Unit of EL Curriculum Planning and Development Division
(CPDD).</p>
<h4>Talent Management</h4>
<p>Students who are good in verbal and writing skills are identified, nurtured,
and given showcase opportunities through competitions such as the PESA,
Creative Writing Competitions, HAIKU Poetry Writing Competitions, National
Spelling Championship, National Lit Quiz, and Wits and Words.</p>
<p>Identified students attend enrichment programmes to further hone their
skills. These include programmes like Reading Circle, Journalism for Kids
and Debating Skills.</p>

<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>At CHIJ (Katong) Primary School, the Drama Club CCA nurtures students'
passion and interest in the performing arts. Through engaging and experiential
learning, members are encouraged to express themselves creatively and confidently
in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>Aligned with the framework for 21st Century Competencies, the CCA focuses
on building students' confidence and communication skills. Members develop
key abilities such as articulation, voice projection, and public speaking,
alongside essential theatre skills including mime, movement, characterisation,
role-play, improvisation, body awareness and damatisation.</p>
<p>Through individual, paired and group work, students learn to collaborate
effectively with peers from diverse backgrounds. These shared experiences
help them develop teamwork, empathy, and resilience as they work together
towards common goals, both on and off the stage.</p>

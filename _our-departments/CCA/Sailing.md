<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>Sailing is the skill of using the wind to move a boat across the water.
Through hands-on learning, students discover how to control the sails,
steer safely, and work together as a team. Sailing helps develop confidence,
responsibility, and a love for the outdoors. With the continued support
of our dedicated teachers, coaches, and parents, our students learn, grow,
and thrive both on and off the water.</p>

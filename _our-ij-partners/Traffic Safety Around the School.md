<p><strong><u>Drop-Off and Pick-Up by Cars</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. Please note that Martia Road leading into the school is an enhanced
school zone - no parking and waiting during the morning period from 6.45
am to 8.00 am and afternoon dismissal from 12.45 pm to 4.00 pm. In particular,
parents should not park in front of the gates of the row of terrace houses
opposite the school at Gate 1, as this will be an inconvenience to the
residents who are driving their cars in / out of their houses.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who pick up their daughters at Gate 1 along
Martia Road shall not stop / park their cars along St Patrick’s Road and
walk to the school to wait for their daughters.&nbsp; This will create
obstruction to traffic along St Patrick’s Road and cause inconvenience
to the residents living there.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do arrive at Gate 1, <strong>15 minutes after dismissal time</strong> to
allow the school buses to leave the school premises first for the safety
of our girls.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who fetch their daughters at Gate 3 along
Marine Parade Road will only be allowed to wait along the road between
lamp posts 40A to 46A and you are reminded not to park and wait alongside
or in the bus bay.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic Police and LTA enforcement officers are frequently
deployed around the school to issue summonses to errant drivers who flout
traffic rules.&nbsp; The school, together with the residents around the
school, will also seek LTA’s assistance to enhance enforcement action,
if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure smooth traffic flow during dismissal, parents
should show patience while queuing to reach the school gate to fetch their
daughters.&nbsp; Any cutting in line will only worsen the traffic flow.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA’s advice on public health seeks the help of schools
to remind our parents to switch off their engines while waiting to fetch
their children from school.&nbsp; Under the Environmental Protection and
Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence to leave
the engine of a motor vehicle running when it is stationary for reasons
other than traffic conditions.&nbsp; Errant motorists can be fined up to
a maximum of $5000.</p>
<p>We seek your kind co-operation in being considerate and gracious to ensure
that our roads are safe for our children.</p>
<p><strong><u>Students Walking to School</u></strong>
</p>
<p>8. Parents and students walking to the school should use the proper pedestrian
walk path and observing the proper pedestrian crossings whenever possible.</p>
<p>9. Foot paths along Martia Road and Marine Parade Road are available and
should be used. Overhead bridge (outside Gate 2) should also be used when
crossing to the bus stop opposite.</p>
<p>10. Students can enter the school via all 3 school gates within the respective
gate operating hours.</p>
<p><strong><u>Students taking Public Transport to School</u></strong>
</p>
<p>11. Wait for the bus to stop completely before boarding or alighting.</p>
<p>12. Never play or stand in the bus bay.</p>
<p><strong><u>Students Cycling to School</u></strong>

<p>14. Dismount and push the bicycle when using the pedestrian crossing.</p>
<p>15. Do not cycle within the school compound. Push your bicycle in and
out of the school.</p>

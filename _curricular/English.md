### English

#### Our Vision


**_Empowered individuals who are proficient and confident users of the English Language_**

  

Our aim is to build a strong foundation, nurture confidence and instill the love of learning.

  

CHIJ (Katong) Primary uses both Stellar (the national English Language curriculum) and our school-based curriculum to achieve the outcomes specified by MOE's English Language Syllabus.

  

The English Language Syllabus focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.

#### School-based curriculum

To build a strong foundation and rich language, we use a variety of print and non-print resources to broaden our students' language exposure and learning experiences so that they will develop an appreciation for the use of language in various contexts according to the purpose, audience and culture. We continuously strive to enhance our teaching to enrich learning for our students. It includes the following teaching and learning programmes:

  

P1: Speech &amp; Drama<br>
P2: Readers' Theatre<br>
P3: Story Telling<br>
P4: Public Speaking<br>
P5: Debate

#### Active Use of English


Students are encouraged to read widely and given various platforms to apply the skills that they have acquired. Some of these include presentations, performances and emceeing.

  

Students who are good in verbal and writing skills are identified, nurtured and given showcase opportunities though competitions such as the PESA, Creative Writing Competitions, HAIKU Poetry Writing Competitions, National Spelling Championship, National Lit Quiz, Junior Orators and Wits &amp; Words.

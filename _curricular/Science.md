## Science

### HOD's Message


To become independent, active and creative learners through the processes of inquiry and investigation, incorporating technology and thinking skills.

#### 1) The Living Classroom at East Coast Park

"The Living Classroom" nature trail is specially designed to engage our Primary 5 students in a meaningful educational experience beyond the classroom walls. The students are led by their fellow classmates who have been trained as nature guides. During the trail, the students will be immersed in a realm of knowledge related to flora and fauna, which will not only captivate their senses but bring them closer to nature!

#### 2) 'Let's Recycle with our Neighbours' Project


Reduce, reuse, recycle is a phrase that many of us are acquainted with. At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, we attempt to incorporate these principles into the classroom to pass it on to the next generation. In collaboration with our parent volunteers, the science monitors embark on a visit around the neighbourhood to gather newspapers for recycling. Such an activity can help our students in character-building and to create an awareness about the needs to conserve and save the environment.

#### 3) 'Let's Recycle with our Friends and Fathers'


In an effort to help drive the message of recycling, the students are encouraged to bring in their newspapers every last week of the month, which is dedicated to recycling week. We enlist the assistance of the students' fathers in this project and in doing so, build a meaningful partnership with them.

#### 4) Science Fun Day @ IJ


Science Fun Day is spent discovering all things science. The science monitors are tasked with conducting interesting and engaging experiments for their schoolmates, which provide them with the opportunity to get first-hand experience at exploring and discovering various scientific concepts.

#### 5) Local Learning Journeys


Learning journeys to either the Science Centre or the Singapore Zoological Gardens are conducted for the P3 to P6 students as an extension to the current Science syllabus. It is through such trips that the students become more acquainted and aware of conservation efforts, scientific concepts and much more.

#### 6) E2K Programme


This is a science enrichment programme targeted for P4 and P5 students who show a high aptitude in science. The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills as well as nurture important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

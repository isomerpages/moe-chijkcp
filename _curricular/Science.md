## Science

### HOD's Message


To become independent, active and creative learners through the processes of inquiry and investigation, incorporating technology and thinking skills.

1) The Living Classroom at East Coast Park

"The Living Classroom" nature trail is specially designed to engage our Primary 5 students in a meaningful educational experience beyond the classroom walls. The students are led by their fellow classmates who have been trained as nature guides. During the trail, the students will be immersed in a realm of knowledge related to flora and fauna, which will not only captivate their senses but bring them closer to nature!

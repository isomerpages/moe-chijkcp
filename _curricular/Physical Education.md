### Physical Education

#### Vision


**_Healthy Body & Healthy Mind_**

#### Mission


**_To empower pupils and staff to feel good about themselves through involvement in sports and recreational endeavours for personal excellence in life._**

  

The purpose of Physical Education (PE) is to enable students to demonstrate individually with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

  

**<u>Key Programmes:</u>**

  

**1) Lower Primary Games Day & Sports Day / Carnival**

  

Students get to play inter-class/house games and earn points for their houses. Leading to these events, students will practice and train during PE lessons. School staff representing the 4 houses will participate to earn points for their houses, too!

  

**2) SwimSafer Programme**

  

The SwimSaferTMÂ 2.0 programme aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children to minimize drowning incidences in a fun manner. The six-stage programme includes survival and activity skills taught at each stage, and work progressively towards the next stage. At the end of each stage, students will receive a stage completion e-certificate.

  

The swimming lessons are conducted during PE lessons at Primary 3.

  

**3) Level Sports / Physical Activities**

  

In addition to the PE curriculum, students in Primary 3, 4 and 6 will participate in a level sport/physical activity at the end of Term 2 or Term 4. These could be an extension of what is covered during PE lessons or something new. Students in Primary 5 will attend an adventure cohort camp at an MOE Outdoor and Adventure Learning Centre, where they will learn more about their strengths, teamwork and camaraderie, in an outdoor setting.

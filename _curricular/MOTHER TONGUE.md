<p>A safe, happy and harmonious environment invites children to take risks,
make mistakes and learn. In CHIJ (Katong) Primary, the Mother Tongue Language
department strives to create this happy and safe environment to engage
our students in fun way of learning MTL through their primary education
with us. By incorporating stories, songs and games into our lessons at
the lower primary levels, we hope to ignite their interest in the language.
ICT tools and other resources are also used to excite and support their
learning.</p>
<p>In middle primary levels, there is more emphasis on the oral, reading,
writing and comprehension skills to prepare students for more complex linguistic
skills in the upper primary. In upper primary, focus will be on enhancing
all language skills taught to prepare them for PSLE.</p>

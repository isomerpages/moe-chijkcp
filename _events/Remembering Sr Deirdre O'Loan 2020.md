Dear Friends,

  

We remember with fondness Sr. Deirdre who left us four years ago. Her love of God permeated all aspects of her life – as a zealous missionary, an inspiring leader, serving others with humility and love, always bringing the best in others and making a difference in their lives.

May we united with her in prayer and love.

  

  

Sr Maria

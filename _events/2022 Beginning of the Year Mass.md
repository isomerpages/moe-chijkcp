## 2022 Beginning of the Year Mass


### BOY Mass


The School started the New Year with a Mass celebrated by Fr Gabriel Wong on the 6th of January.

The theme for the Mass was Communicate with Love. In the Gospel, we are reminded that we belong to God who is our shepherd and we will always be protected by HIM.

In the Homily, Fr Gabriel spoke on our need to listen to Jesus, Our Shepherd.

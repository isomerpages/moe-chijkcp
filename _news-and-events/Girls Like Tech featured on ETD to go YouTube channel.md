## Girls Like Tech featured on ETD-to-go YouTube channel


In 2020, MOE Educational Technology Division (ETD) came to CHIJ (Katong) Primary to film our Primary 2 students using Kamibots during one of our GLT-Chinese Language lessons.

  

The production team had a great time and enjoyed working on the video production with the students and teachers.

  

The students were energetic and co-operative throughout the whole filming process and helped make it an exciting experience for the production team to video the activities in the "Girls Like Tech" programme.

  

A big thank you to all teachers who nurture our students into confident, competent and respectful communicators.

  

The video is hosted on ETD-to-go YouTube channel and is accessible atÂ [https://go.gov.sg/happenings-chij-katong-pri](https://go.gov.sg/happenings-chij-katong-pri).

  

It is also available via the ETD-to-go Facebook page.

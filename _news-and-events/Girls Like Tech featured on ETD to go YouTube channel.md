<h2>Girls Like Tech featured on ETD-to-go YouTube channel</h2>
<p>In 2020, MOE Educational Technology Division (ETD) came to CHIJ (Katong)
    Primary to film our Primary 2 students using Kamibots during one of our
    GLT-Chinese Language lessons.</p>
<p>The production team had a great time and enjoyed working on the video
    production with the students and teachers.</p>
<p>The students were energetic and co-operative throughout the whole filming
    process and helped make it an exciting experience for the production team
    to video the activities in the "Girls Like Tech" programme.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all teachers who nurture our students into confident,
    competent and respectful communicators.</p>

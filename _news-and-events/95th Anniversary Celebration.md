<p>On 10 March 2025, CHIJ (Katong) Primary joyfully launched its 95th Anniversary
Celebrations, marking nearly a century of nurturing hearts and minds. The
atmosphere was filled with gratitude and excitement as students and staff
came together for this momentous occasion.</p>
<p>The event began with a heartfelt video journey through the school’s rich
history, showcasing its humble beginnings at Caldwell House in 1930 and
its legacy of excellence today. A touching tribute honoured key individuals
who contributed to the school, including Mrs. Jacinta Lee, a former student
turned teacher, Ms. Rina Oon, an alumna who returned as an administrator,
and Mr Puah Lai Teck (Uncle Ah Teck), the school’s beloved long-serving
staff member since 1970.</p>
<p>The highlight of the launch was a powerful moment when four symbolic hearts
merged into one, accompanied by rousing cheers of “Love Never Fails!” led
by Mrs. Simon, our Principal, a proud four-generation IJ girl. This officially
marked the beginning of a year of exciting events, including the 95 Acts
of Service, a Carnival on 2 October, and a Thanksgiving Celebration on
17 November.</p>
<p>As CHIJ (Katong) Primary celebrates 95 years of faith, love, and service,
the school remains committed to shaping young girls into women of grace
and strength. With gratitude for the past and hope for the future, we embrace
this milestone as one united IJ family.</p>
<p>Here’s to 95 years of love and timeless moments—because truly, Love Never
Fails!</p>

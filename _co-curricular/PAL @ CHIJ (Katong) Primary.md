<h2>PAL @ CHIJ (Katong) Primary</h2>
<p>PAL (Programme for Active Learning) was introduced to strengthen the emphasis
on non-academic programmes for Primary 1 and 2 students. This is in line
with a key desired outcome of PERI recommendations to balance the acquisition
of knowledge with the development of skills and values and to prepare our
children for a more dynamic future. Conducted within curriculum time, PAL
modules provide students with broad exposure in two areas — Sports and
Games, Outdoor Education and Performing and Visual Arts. It aims to facilitate
the well-rounded development of students in the five learning domains (cognitive,
moral, social, aesthetics and physical) and help students to develop social
emotional competencies.</p>
<p>PAL modules are experiential in nature and incorporate learning in a creative,
fun, and enjoyable way. Each PAL module will be conducted for at least
2 hours a week with each module lasting between 7 to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>The Primary 1 will cover the Visual Arts, Drama and Outdoor Education
modules. The Primary 2 will cover Drama, Visual Arts and Traditional Games
modules.</p>
<p>At the end of Primary 2, all students would have been exposed to at least
6 different modules, from the two areas of Sports and Outdoor Education,
Performing and Visual Arts.</p>
<p>The PAL modules at CHIJ (Katong) Primary:</p>
<h4>Sports and Games /Traditional Games</h4>
<p>Students are introduced to various traditional games played by children
in the olden days. They are given the opportunity to experience these games
and create their own. During PAL lessons, students will be exposed to working
in groups or pairs to complete simple activities and challenges. In the
process, they will be presented with opportunities to resolve conflicts
and find compromises, through which they will learn to recognize and manage
their emotions and reactions to achieve the desirable outcome.</p>

<h4>Drama</h4>
<p>PAL Drama aims to promote creativity, self-confidence and critical thinking
through various drama and speech activities that provide students opportunities
for active, exploratory and experiential learning. Drama places great value
on the development of students’ capacity for critical thought, which is
imperative in their training to become reflective, compassionate and independent
members of society.</p>
<p>The PAL Drama lessons are activity-oriented and use the hands-on approach.
Students get to participate in interactive drama activities that allow
them to understand and appreciate the arts and love language. Some of these
activities include role playing, hot seating, conscience alley and tableaux
among others. The teacher acts as a guide to allow for creative development
and expression, constantly motivating a child that is already dynamic in
her own way.</p>

<h4>Outdoor Education</h4>
<p>PAL OE provides opportunities for students to engage in activities outdoors
as the main aim of this module is to instil in our students the love of
nature. They will learn how nature affects them and vice versa. Activities
planned will expose our students to various aspects of nature catered to
their level of learning. Students will be able to interact with each other
as they learn and play games. This exposure will aid in the holistic development
of our students.</p>

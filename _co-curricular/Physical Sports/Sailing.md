### SYNOPSIS:


Sailing is great fun and rewarding to learn, no matter what your age or experience is. It specifically refers to the sport of using wind to power sails and propel the boat forward. Learning to sail takes a couple of days of tuition - but generally it’s a sport you will be able to pick up quickly in the right conditions. Gentle winds make for perfect weather for beginners.

### What is sailing?


Sailing is….

*   using the wind to move your boat across the water
*   riding the waves
*   ever-changing
*   a continuous challenge
*   about making decisions
*   understanding currents, wind, oceanography, and the marine environment
*   a dynamic domain that requires all-rounded fitness.

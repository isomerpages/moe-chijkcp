## Artistic Gymnastics


**(Modular CCA)**

  

**Level**: P3 to P6<br>
**DAY:** Tuesday (2.00 pm - 3.30 pm)<br>
**TEACHERS I/C:** \*Mdm Ang Bee Bee & Ms Jenny Koh<br>
**VENUE:** School

### SYNOPSIS:


The CCA aims to develop in each gymnast significant values and skills for life as they explore basic movements through a variety of tasks. These movements develop self-discipline, physical and emotional strength, joint mobility, balance, co-ordination and good posture.  In conjunction with school study habits, practice for gymnastics can indeed lead a young person into an individual with graceful confidence.  Half-yearly assessment by coaches will be carried out to monitor the progress of pupils and to determine their level of skills. By the end of the course, pupils will be proficient in gymnastic skills and instilled with confidence and sportsmanship.

### SYNOPSIS:


In Sports Club, through collaborations with ActiveSG, we aim to provide opportunities for our students to get active and to experience a variety of sports and outdoor activities. Students will get an opportunity to participate in sports which include Basketball, Floorball, Soccer, Frisbee, Archery and more. In addition, students will learn about Basic First Aid, Tent Pitching and Knot-tying skills. We also organise Learning Journeys to Decathlon and Katong Swimming Pool to learn more about healthy living, sustainable urban farming and life-saving skills. We hope that through these wide array of activities, students are motivated to develop an active and healthy lifestyle for life.

### Information Communications Technology (ICT)


#### The Vision


**_Enhance Empower Engage._**

#### The Mission Statement


**_To infuse the use of ICT in the aspects of the educational process for the benefits of the entire school community._**

#### The Guiding Principle


**_If we teach TODAY as we taught YESTERDAY, we rob our students of TOMORROW._**

#### HOD's Message


People in the 21st century live in a technology and media-suffused environment, marked by various characteristics, including:

1.  access to an abundance of information
2.  rapid changes in technology tools, and
3.  the ability to collaborate and make individual contributions on an unprecedented scale.

  

To be effective in the 21st century, citizens and workers must be able to exhibit a range of functional and critical thinking skills related to information, media and technology.

  

In this Digital Generation Age, “digital” children do not learn in isolation. They might be alone, but they learn in groups. For them, knowledge is like dropping a pebble in the pond. Waves of understanding wash over the digital classroom. Working out an answer and sharing it with your digital classmate is no longer considered cheating. Cheating is keeping the answer to yourself. Learning is collaborative and social, NOT solitary and competitive.

  

At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, the ICT programme has been tailored to ensure that the latter is met.

  

The ICT programmes for 2020 are as follows:

  

1. **Acquiring Computer skills Education in Infocommunication Technology! (ACE-iT!)**

ACE-iT! is a structured 6-year programme for P1-P6 pupils. Pupils undergo a comprehensive programme where the acquisition of essential ICT skills is learnt. The deliverables are a project customized by the level teachers which incorporate ICT skills with the curriculum. Upon completion of the programme, each pupil will receive a certificate, a Rubric card and a badge to mark their achievement.

  

2\. **iEnrich Programme**

During the term breaks, different levels of pupils will be invited to participate in the holiday enrichment programme.

  

Here the pupils have an extension of the ACE-iT! skills that have been taught. Interested pupils will sign up for a 4-6 hour (depending on the level) programme where a particular ICT skill will be imparted to them.

  

3\. **e-Learning @ IJ (iLearn & Project CLICK)**

It is commonly thought that new technologies can make a big difference in education. One such technology initiative implemented by CHIJ (Katong) Primary since 2004 is e-Learning. Each pupil subscribes to a McOnline portal account where a rich variety of curriculum resources are available for both the teachers and the pupils. Every month, there is a day that has been set aside for the pupils to not have any written work. This day is known as iLearn @ IJ. Instead they do their homework online. Once a semester, pupils will undergo Project CLICK @ IJ – an independent e-learning day where the objectives are for pupils to experience independent learning, be exposed to a different learning environment and be operationally ready in a national emergency.

  

Once a term, students will also have the opportunity to have fun through technology in our programme called Wireless@ the G – children explore various tools such as laptops, internet surfing, playing games through the use of iPad, game consoles (Wii etc.) during recess time.

  

In conclusion, the future @ IJ is an exciting adventure where we are working towards textbooks being replaced by rich, interactive content and technology transforms learning into a real-time, collective and multi-dimensional experience. Pupils everywhere interact through sharing and connectivity.

  

In the words of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s 2006 National Day Rally Speech, “We are preparing our young for this new age (Digital Age). We have made IT an integral part of our school life. With IT, we make the most of our talents. Singapore is changing and we must change.”

### SYNOPSIS:


The Home Craft Club aims to equip our girls with basic life skills. Here they learn how to conduct basic / simple housekeeping that they can manage individually, do simple stitches, make handicrafts and bake simple snack. They learn to work and assist one another despite being in different levels.

Here are some pictures of the activities that the girls were engaged in.

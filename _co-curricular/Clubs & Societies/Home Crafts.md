### SYNOPSIS:


The Home Craft Club aims to equip our girls with basic life skills. Here they learn how to conduct basic / simple housekeeping that they can manage individually, do simple stitches, make handicrafts and bake simple snack. They learn to work and assist one another despite being in different levels.

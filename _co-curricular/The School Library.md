The School eResource Repository is a virtual school library and aims to promote recreational reading as well as support learning for students accross various subjects areas. The repository also provided easy access to online resources such as eBooks, audiobooks, videos and web resources.

  

You can also browse, borrow and enjoy titles from the [National Library Board](https://nlb.overdrive.com/collection/21779) digital collection

  

  

The School Library @ CHIJ (Katong) Primary is a vibrant and colourful haunt for our pupils.<br>
They relish reading the wide range of books and magazines and playing the exciting computer games available in the library. Each girl is allowed to borrow 4 books (at least 2 MTL books) fortnightly, including CD-ROMs from the library.

  

From 2019, Ms Sharon Lim is the Library Coordinator, with Mrs Faith Heng (Subject Head/English Language) as the Overall In-Charge. Other members include Mrs Macrina Fernandez and Mdm Hamidah, the librarian. We work together to organise programmes that will instill good reading habits in our girls.

  

The following are the various **NEW** initiatives planned for the pupils:

*   Silent Reading (USSR) to be conducted before school starts.

    *   From Monday to Wednesday, students are to bring English story books to read before flag-raising ceremony.
    *   From Thursday to Friday, they have to bring a MTL book to read. NTIL students will bring an English book instead.

*   More regular Mobile Library @ Canteen (EL and MT): To make it more convenient for the pupils to borrow books, a book kiosk will be set up in the canteen during recess.
*   Storytelling@Recesses: Parent-Volunteers read to girls in the Library to enthuse them to read interesting books of different genres during their recesses (P1 & P2; P3 & P4)      
*   Fortnightly schedules for Library periods (P1& P2): EL teachers will lead their classes to the library fortnightly to borrow books.
*   Books In Bag for P1 & P2 (BIB): Each child will use a bag with her register number and leave it for Mdm Hamidah to scan the books. She will deliver to the classroom when it is done and collect the bags from the class on a later date.
*   Display of Class Readership Chart / Super Reader Awards per term at Assembly & on the library door
*   Long Recess activities like Origami, Treasure Hunt etc.
*   Assembly Book Talks by authors

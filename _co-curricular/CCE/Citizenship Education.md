### Citizenship Education

The school aims to develop students cross cultural skills, global awareness and civic literacy through the National Education (NE) programmes.

#### National Education


The NE commemorative days, such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, aim to cultivate appreciation of cultural diversity and to develop students as concerned citizens who stay rooted to Singapore.

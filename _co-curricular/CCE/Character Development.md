<h3>Character Development</h3>
<p>In nurturing our girls to be Women of Grace and Substance, our character
education focuses on the four School Virtues (<strong>Self-Discipline, Compassion, Respect and Integrity</strong>).
These virtues are upheld and expressed by our staff and students in our
daily lives.</p>
<h4>Values Education</h4>
<p>The School Virtues Programme and Value-in-Action Programme provide a rich
learning experience through a variety of learning activities, some of which
are collaboration with our community partners. The programmes aim to imbue
our students with the virtues necessary for them to lead a flourishing
life and to provide them with opportunities to serve the community and
to appreciate the joy in contributing to society and enrich the lives of
all.</p>
<h4>Peer Support &amp; Social Skills Programme</h4>
<p>The Peer Support Programme builds a school culture of care and strengthen
the network of positive relationships. Students learn social emotional
skills during lessons and develop strong peer support through interaction
with their friends.</p>

<h4>Grace &amp; Love Programme</h4>
<p>Our Catechism classes aimed at helping students to understand their faith
and live the gospel values in their daily lives. School activities such
as retreats, Praise and Worship sessions and Rosary devotions are conducted
for Catholic students to help them deepen their faith. The Catholic students
attend Family Masses and all students attend the School Masses.</p>
<p>Ethnic lessons aligned with our School Virtues are conducted for our non-Catholic
students.</p>

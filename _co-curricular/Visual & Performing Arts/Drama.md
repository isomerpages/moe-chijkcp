### SYNOPSIS:


At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, the Drama Club CCA seeks to develop members' passion and interest in the performing arts. In line with the framework for 21st century competencies, the CCA aims to build their confidence. Skills such as articulation, voice projection and public speaking are learnt and practiced alongside theatre skills such a mime, movement, characterisation, role-play, improvisation, body awareness and dramatisation. By working individually, in pairs/trios and in groups, members learn to work collaboratively with different groups of people to achieve a common goal.

  

The Drama Club also aims to develop our talent by ensuring that students who have potential in Theatre for Direct School Admission (DSA) are nominated for the annual SOTA's DSA platform: Talent Academy (Theatre). After participating in the various activities at the Talent Academy, successful nominees will be shortlisted for DSA.

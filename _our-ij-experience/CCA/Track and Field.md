<p>Track &amp; Field is a sport that includes athletic contests established
on the skills of running, jumping and throwing. In Track &amp; Field, consistency
is key to performing in the Track &amp; Field event(s), while developing
values and attributes such as grit, determination, resilience and teamwork
that will prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Taking part in
competitions and the National School Games has also exposed the athletes
to varied experiences.</p>
<h3>From our past students:</h3>
<p>Training sessions were really fun and enjoyable. I always look forward
to participating in competitions with my teammates. I also learnt many
valuable lessons in these past 4 years. I am glad I chose Track &amp; Field
as my CCA.</p>

<p>When I first joined Track &amp; Field, I felt that I didn't fit in and
wasn't fast enough. But the friends that I have made, coaches and teachers,
helped and encouraged me a lot. The sessions might be tiring but they are
really fun. I've learnt a lot of things too! I'll miss Track &amp; Field
in this school.</p>

</p>
<p>Throughout the years in the Track &amp; Field team, I have formed valuable
friendships and we went through thick and thin together. Despite the covid-19
pandemic, the coaches and teachers have found ways to help us train and
hone our skills and talent in our respective events.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong><em>Chloe Chan, JO6 of 2021</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Having track and field as my CCA was probably one of the best decisions
I’ve made. As a slow little clueless Primary 3, I slowly came to learn
about one very important value- sportsmanship. I will never forget how
the coaches and teachers valued this more than if you were “talented” in
track and field. It doesn’t matter if you are fast or slow. Commitment
and a ready state of mind to do your best will help overcome all challenges.
I will never regret my decision to join track and field.</p>

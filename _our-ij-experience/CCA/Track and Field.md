<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>During Track &amp; Field CCA sessions, students can look forward to learning
a range of skills like running, jumping and throwing. Through drills and
trainings, we seek to develop values and attributes such as grit, determination,
resilience and teamwork. Students are given opportunities to participate
in competitions based on their performance during training. More importantly,
they develop all-round physical fitness which contributes to an active
and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>Starting gymnastics is a great way to improve physically, mentally and
socially. Gymnastics training can build studentsâ€™ physical strength, stamina,
flexibility, agility, coordination and balance. It provides them the platform
to discover and learn various body movements with control as well as develop
confidence in what thier body can perform safely.</p>
<p>The modular Gymnastics CCA introduces students to some of the foundational
gymnastic skills. These skills enable them to apply the fundamentals learnt
in other sport too.</p>
<p>Besides requiring basic gymnastics skills, our girls also develop teamwork
and friendships with their peers.</p>

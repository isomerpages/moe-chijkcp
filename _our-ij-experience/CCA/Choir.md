<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>The CHIJ (Katong) Primary Choir was formed in 2001. The choir sings music
from all genres including jazz and songs in different languages. The students
enjoy singing and look forward to their twice a week practices with great
eagerness. They also love songs that are challenging and interesting. The
discipline and rigorous training that the members undertake play a crucial
role not only in preparing them musically for their performances but also
for their personal growth as singers and as valued members of the school
choir. During Choir practices, the students will build friendships, develop
discipline, resilience and self-confidence.</p>
<p>By the end of the four years, members will be able to sing confidently
as a group at internal and external choral events in 2 or 3 parts. They
will have opportunities to sing songs in other languages (apart from English
and MTL commonly used in Singapore) and develop to be disciplined and confident
singers.</p>

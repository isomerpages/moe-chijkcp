<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p>At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, the Drama Club CCA seeks to develop members’
passion and interest in the performing arts.</p>
<p>In line with the framework for 21st century competencies, the CCA aims
to build their confidence. Skills such as articulation, voice projection
and public speaking are acquired and practised alongside theatre skills
such as mime, movement, characterisation, role-play, improvisation, body
awareness and dramatisation.</p>
<p>By working individually, in pairs/trios and in groups, members learn to
work collaboratively with different groups of people to achieve a common
goal.</p>
<p>The Drama Club also aims to develop our talent by ensuring that students
who have potential in Theatre for Direct School Admission (DSA) are nominated
for the annual SOTA’s DSA platform: Talent Academy (Theatre). After participating
in the various activities at the Talent Academy, successful nominees will
be shortlisted for DSA.</p>

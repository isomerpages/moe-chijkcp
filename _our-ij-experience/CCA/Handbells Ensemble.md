<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>The CHIJ (Katong) Primary Handbell Ensemble was established in 2004, with
the aim of providing an opportunity for students with varied musical abilities
and skills to make music together. We believe in giving our students exposure
to unique and delicate musical instruments and different genres of music.
In doing so, we hope to equip students with the skills and confidence to
perform in school-based or public events, thereby nurturing and surfacing
young talents in music and performing arts. Handbells teach teamwork and
cooperation, fostering self-esteem and developing much-needed physical
and social skills. It provides a full measure of musical enjoyment for
all who play them.</p>
<h4>Pre-requisite:</h4>

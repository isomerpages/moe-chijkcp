<h4>VISION:</h4>
<p>The CHIJ(Katong) Primary Handbell Ensemble was established in 2004, with
the aim of providing an opportunity for students with varied musical abilities
and skills to make music together.</p>
<h4>ACTIVITIES:</h4>
<p>During practice sessions, students are exposed to unique and delicate
musical instruments and different genres of music. They are taught ringing
techniques of varying difficulty levels, at a pace catered to their progress.
Seniors also learn to serve and guide the juniors by showing empathy and
compassion and respect.</p>
<p>We also go on learning journeys to watch other performing arts groups
to instill and develop their appreciation of the arts. Handbells teach
teamwork and cooperation, fostering self-esteem and developing much-needed
physical and social skills. It provides a full measure of musical enjoyment
for all who play them.</p>
<p>Through school and public events, we aim to equip them with the skills
and confidence to perform in school-based or public events, thereby nurturing
and surfacing young talents in music and the performing arts.</p>
<h4>Pre-requisite:</h4>
<p>Must be able to commit from P3 â€“ P6</p>

<h3>Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
<p>As part of the school’s effort to provide a holistic education for our
students, all P3 to P6 students are strongly encouraged to join a CCA.
Through active participation in the CCAs, they will learn life skills such
as confidence, perseverance and resilience.</p>
<p>We have a range of CCAs covering 4 broad areas namely; physical sports;
clubs and societies, visual and performing arts, and uniformed groups.
Students learn life and social skills during the CCA sessions. We hope
they will pick up the skills necessary for life-long pursuit, if they choose
to. Participation in CCAs gives them an opportunity to discover their talent
or interest in the non-academic aspect of their education.</p>
<p>Since 2010, we have embarked on a modular CCA Programme to give students
even more opportunities to experience a range of CCAs throughout their
primary education at CHIJ (Katong) Primary. They get to change CCA every
semester where they pick up new skills and make more friends!</p>
<p>Students who have very strong inclination / aptitude towards a certain
CCA will be invited to join the developmental teams where they can further
hone their skills through customized training programme.</p>
<h4>Our School Policy</h4>
<p>P3 to P6 students are strongly encouraged to join&nbsp;<strong>*one</strong>&nbsp;CCA.
P6 students will be required to participate in CCAs only in Semester 1.</p>
<p>*As there will be more vacancies in Semester 2, students may take up a
2nd CCA in Semester 2 (provided the schedules do not clash). Parents are
to make a written request, via email to the HOD PE/CCA.</p>
<p>Under the modular CCA, students will participate in 2 different CCAs per
year, one per semester.</p>
<p>Under the non-modular CCA, each student will be required to remain in
the CCA throughout the whole year, till Primary 6 (Semester 1).</p>
<h4>Change of CCA</h4>
<p>Students should commit to the CCA for the whole semester or year.</p>
<p>Change of CCA is only allowed at the end of the semester or year.</p>
<h4>CCA Attendance</h4>
<p>An explanation in written form from parents, or a doctor’s medical certificate
is required to be submitted to the teacher-in-charge whenever a student
fails to attend a session.</p>
<h4>Exemption from School's CCA</h4>
<p>Parents are to write in to the Principal to seek approval for exemption.</p>
<h4>Transport Arrangement</h4>
<p>Parents are to make their own transport arrangement after CCAs.</p>

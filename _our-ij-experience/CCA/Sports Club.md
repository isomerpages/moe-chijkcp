<h3>SYNOPSIS:</h3>
<p>In Sports Club, through collaborations with ActiveSG, we aim to provide
opportunities for our students to get active and to experience a variety
of sports and outdoor activities. Students will get an opportunity to participate
in sports which include Basketball, Floorball, Soccer, Frisbee, Archery
and more. In addition, students will learn about Basic First Aid, Tent
Pitching and Knot-tying skills. We also organise Learning Journeys to Decathlon
and Katong Swimming Pool to learn more about healthy living, sustainable
urban farming and life-saving skills. We hope that through these wide array
of activities, students are motivated to develop an active and healthy
lifestyle for life.</p>

### SYNOPSIS:


At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, the Drama Club CCA seeks to develop members’ passion and interest in the performing arts.

In line with the framework for 21st century competencies, the CCA aims to build
their confidence. Skills such as articulation, voice projection and public speaking are acquired and practised alongside theatre skills such as mime, movement,
characterisation, role-play, improvisation, body awareness and dramatisation.

By working individually, in pairs/trios and in groups, members learn to work
collaboratively with different groups of people to achieve a common goal.

The Drama Club also aims to develop our talent by ensuring that students who have potential in Theatre for Direct School Admission (DSA) are nominated for the
annual SOTA’s DSA platform: Talent Academy (Theatre). After participating in the
various activities at the Talent Academy, successful nominees will be shortlisted for
DSA.

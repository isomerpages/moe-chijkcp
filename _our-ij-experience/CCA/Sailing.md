<h4>SYNOPSIS:</h4>
<p>Sailing is the art of using wind to propel a boat across water. It involves
navigating by harnessing the wind's power with sails, which are adjusted
to optimize their angle relative to the wind direction. Key aspects of
sailing include understanding wind patterns, sail trim, and boat handling.
Sailors use various techniques to change direction and maintain course.
Sailing is also valued for its recreational and adventurous aspects, offering
a blend of skill, strategy, and connection to nature.</p>

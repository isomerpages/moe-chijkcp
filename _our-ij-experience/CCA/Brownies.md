<h4>Synopsis:</h4>
<p>Brownies enjoy learning and having amazing adventures together! Brownies
are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them and to become
more independent. They are constantly learning new skills and challenged
to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about
what they want to be and do in the future. Brownies learn to work and play
independently and in teams.</p>
<p>On special occasions, Brownies do fun things together with other Brownie
or Girl Guide units for joint learning adventures! Brownies are guided
by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops them in 5 areas. Brownies
enjoy working for interest badges and awards that will help them develop
new skills.</p>

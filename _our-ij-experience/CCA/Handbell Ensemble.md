### SYNOPSIS:


The CHIJ (Katong) Primary Handbell Ensemble was established in 2004, with the aim of providing an opportunity for students with varied musical abilities and skills to make music together. We believe in giving our students exposure to unique and delicate musical instruments and different genres of music. In doing so, we hope to equip students with the skills and confidence to perform in school-based or public events, thereby nurturing and surfacing young talents in music and performing arts. Handbells teach teamwork and cooperation, fostering self-esteem and developing much-needed physical and social skills. It provides a full measure of musical enjoyment for all who play them.

<p>The Innovation Club is part of our Girls Like Tech (GLT) programme and
it aims to develop creative and innovative thinking in our students. The
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) and Makers activities
will provide opportunities for them to be adventurous problem-solvers,
beyond their comfort zone and at the same time develop perseverance and
resilience.</p>

embrace failures.</p>

### SYNOPSIS:

The Innovation Club is part of our Girls Like Tech (GLT) programme and it aims to develop creative and innovative thinking in our students. The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) and Makers activities will provide opportunities for them to be adventurous problem-solvers, beyond their comfort zone and at the same time develop perseverance and resilience.

Through collaborative projects, students learn to celebrate success and embrace failures.

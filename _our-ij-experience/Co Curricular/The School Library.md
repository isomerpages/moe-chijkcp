<p>The School Library @ CHIJ (Katong) Primary is a vibrant and colourful
haunt for our pupils.
<br>They relish reading the wide range of books and magazines and playing
the exciting computer games available in the library. Each girl is allowed
to borrow 4 books (at least 2 MTL books) fortnightly, including CD-ROMs
from the library.</p>
<p>From 2019, Ms Sharon Lim is the Library Coordinator, with Mrs Faith Heng
(Subject Head/English Language) as the Overall In-Charge. Other members
include Mrs Macrina Fernandez and Mdm Hamidah, the librarian. We work together
to organise programmes that will instill good reading habits in our girls.</p>

planned for the pupils:</p>

will bring an English book instead.</p>

<p>To promote the love for reading in our school, our students are invited
to participate in the following programmes:</p>
<p><strong>1) Library Orientation</strong>
</p>
<p>To promote the love for reading in our school, our students are invited
to participate in the following programmes:</p>
<p><strong>2) Thematic Displays &amp; Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>To encourage reading in the school, our library features monthly book
collections according to themes. Some of the themes featured are ‘Book
Character Day’, ‘Cyber Wellness’ and ‘Earth Day’. Themes and book collections
are highlighted during morning assemblies. Our library also promotes books
written by authors such as Roald Dahl, Hans Christian Andersen and Louis
Sachar. Students can also participate in the various activities (quizzes,
games etc) that are tied to the thematic book collections.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a lineup of thrilling activities designed for each grade
level!&nbsp; e.g. <strong>For P1: BOOK-a-Date with Parent: </strong>This
programme encourages parents to read with their daughters, fostering a
special bonding session through literature. After selecting a book, students
can dress up and use props for a dramatisation, followed by submitting
a video recording of their performance. It’s a wonderful way to instill
a love for reading!</p>

<p><strong>3) Storytelling @ Recesses</strong>
</p>
<p>During recess on some days, students get to enjoy storytelling sessions
conducted by parent volunteers. The aim of the session is to promote joy
of reading and to encourage students to explore books of different genres.</p>
<p><strong>4) Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (USSR)</strong>
</p>
<p>All students are required to read an English book every Thursday and a
Mother Tongue book every Friday at their assembly areas in the morning.
Through this programme, we hope to cultivate a routine of self-directed
and independent reading.</p>
<p><strong>5) Library Period</strong>
</p>
<p>Getting students to experience the joy of reading is a regular part of
the school’s curriculum. Two periods (one for English, one for Mother Tongue)
are set aside every week for our reading programme. On alternative weeks,
students are taken to the library to borrow books.</p>
<p><strong>6) Book Buzz Tuesday (BBT)</strong>
</p>
<p>Join us every Tuesday for BBT! Before morning assembly, we screen captivating
short story videos featuring colorful animations and recommendations from
students and teachers. Watch our reading ambassadors and fellow students
share their favorite books, sparking curiosity and inspiring everyone to
discover the stories for themselves. Don’t miss out on the excitement!

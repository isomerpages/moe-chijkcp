Character Day’, ‘Cyber Wellness’ and ‘Earth Day’. Themes and book collections
are highlighted during morning assemblies. Our library also promotes books
written by authors such as Roald Dahl, Hans Christian Andersen and Louis
Sachar. Students can also participate in the various activities (quizzes,
games etc) that are tied to the thematic book collections.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a lineup of thrilling activities designed for each grade
level!&nbsp; e.g. <strong>For P1: BOOK-a-Date with Parent: </strong>This
programme encourages parents to read with their daughters, fostering a
special bonding session through literature. After selecting a book, students
can dress up and use props for a dramatisation, followed by submitting
a video recording of their performance. It’s a wonderful way to instill
a love for reading!</p>

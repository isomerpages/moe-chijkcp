### SYNOPSIS:


CHIJ (Katong) Primary Choir was formed in 2001 under the baton of Ms Lim Bee Na.<br>
The choir sings music from all genres including jazz, the songs in different languages. The pupils enjoy singing and they look forward to their twice a week practices with great eagerness. They also love songs that are challenging and interesting. The discipline and rigorous training that the members undertake play a crucial role not only in preparing them musically for their performances but also for their personal growth as singers and as valued members of the school choir.

  

By the end of the four years, members will be able to sing confidently as a group at internal and external choral events in at least 3 parts. They will have the opportunities to sing songs in other languages (apart from English and MTL commonly used in Singapore) and develop to be disciplined and confident singers.

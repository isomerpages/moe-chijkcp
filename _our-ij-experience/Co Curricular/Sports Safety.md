## Sports Safety

Safety is our priority and we seek parentsâ€™ support in helping us to promote a safety culture. Your awareness of sports safety would help children to learn the importance of sport safety measures and practices. For guidelines on safety and information on safety practices, please access the following website:

Through participation in CCAs, our girls also learn and practise our IJ virtues of self-discipline, integrity, respect and commitment. We seek your help in reinforcing these values in our girls, including the ethics of fair-play, good sportsmanship and strong team spirit.

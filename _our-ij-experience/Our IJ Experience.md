<p>At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, we are deeply proud to be part of the esteemed
CHIJ fraternity. Our rich heritage and time-honoured traditions form a
strong connection and foundation for everything we do, shaping the values
we instill in our students and helping them forge a profound sense of belonging,
not just to their school, but to the broader CHIJ family.</p>
<p>Our students are encouraged to see themselves as part of something larger
- a shared identity that spans all CHIJ schools. We nurture this sense
of connection through symbols, meanings, and events that are present in
every CHIJ school. These common features unite us, creating a powerful
and close-knit bond that stretches across generations of CHIJ girls. To
ensure that this bond is more than just a passing association, we have
specially curated programmes and activities that form the cornerstone of
our effort to help our students understand and live out the values that
define the CHIJ spirit. It's more than just planned programmes and activities;
it's a way for our students to connect deeply with the legacy of the CHIJ
family.</p>
<p>As a CHIJ (Katong) Primary pupil, every girl is anchored in the strong
foundation of our school's values, rooted firmly in the love of God and
the teachings of the Catholic Church. She is reminded daily that she is
loved by God, a belief that shapes her heart and mind. Central to this
faith are the Catholic Social Teachings, which emphasize the inherent dignity
of every human being, the importance of the common good, and the value
of each person. These teachings are not abstract ideals - they are principles
that guide our students' actions, helping them become compassionate, thoughtful,
and responsible individuals.</p>
<p>We believe that the heart of a truly successful education goes beyond
academic achievement. It lies in nurturing students who understand the
importance of truth, justice, freedom, and love. By working synergistically,
our students build an IJ community that is strong, united, and committed
to making a positive difference in the world. We aspire to see our students
emerge as leaders who are not only academically capable but also deeply
rooted in values that reflect the very best of the CHIJ tradition.</p>
<p>We provide our students with the tools to carry forward the legacy of
CHIJ, ensuring that they are empowered to become agents of change, champions
of justice, and ambassadors of love in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Empowered Learners who are future – ready</strong>.</p>
<p>The school’s Strategic Objective 1 aims to prepare CHIJ KCP girls for
the challenges that they will face in the real world and in the future.
The world is changing rapidly.&nbsp; Building strong literacy and numeracy,
acquiring social-emotional competencies, and inculcating sound values and
developing them in 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competencies will be needed
to prepare them for the future and make them Learners for Life. The school’s
curriculum and the learning experiences that it offers play an integral
role in ensuring that the Strategic Objective is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>The 3 Strategic Initiatives are:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authentic Learning Experiences that bring
about the Joy Of Learning.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Empowering Curriculum to develop resilient
learners and future – ready learners.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A vibrant learning environment that enhances
teaching and learning.</p>
<p><strong>SI 1 Authentic Learning Experiences that bring about the Joy Of Learning.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Joy of Learning is about having a Purpose of Learning based on intrinsic
motivation. This builds in our students Passion for Learning driven by
the desire to learn more, explore and develop their interests and strengths.
With that, we will see Engagement in Learning and students will experience
a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Authentic Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>At CHIJ KCP, The Joy Of the Learner is fostered through authentic learning
experiences where connections are made between the content and the knowledge,
skills and attitudes needed in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. These authentic
learning experiences are opportunities and platforms for students to apply
the knowledge, skills and attitudes that they have learnt in to their current
and future lives. These experiences will deepen the learning of students,
enabling them to become self – directed and confident, innovative, collaborative,
and resilient.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ICT to engage and empower</strong>
</p>
<p>The effective use of ICT in the classroom will focus on how technological
tools can activate learning, promote thinking and discussion, facilitate
demonstration of learning, and be used for monitoring and feedback by both
teachers and students. Through this active learning process, students are
empowered as they learn 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies such as being
self – directed and collaborative. In addition, the use of ICT in the classroom
will engage and motivate digital learners who have spent most of their
lives surrounded by digital communication technology and who prefer to
be engaged through learning that is relevant, active, and instantly useful.</p>
<p><strong>The Joy of Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>To encourage deep engagement and intrinsic motivation for life – long
learning, Assessment is also an essential part of the learning process
– the curricular objectives, content, and pedagogy. The continuous use
of assessment information to guide teachers in improving their instructional
practices to meet the needs of their students is key. Feedback is also
designed to support students' further learning and encourage them to monitor
and take responsibility for their own learning. Finally, students are able
to learn about themselves as learners and become aware of how they learn.
Students reflect on their work on a regular basis, usually through self
and peer assessment and decide what their next learning step will be. Assessment
helps students to take more responsibility for their own learning. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SI 2 An Empowering Curriculum to develop resilient and future – ready learners</strong>
</p>
<p>Creating an empowering curriculum first begins with re – defining what
success means at CHIJ KCP. In our school, success is visible when our girls
become living examples of the school vision and virtues. When we are able
to create an empowering curriculum that is anchored on these definitions
of success, then our girls will have the opportunity to shine based on
their own talents and strengths. This will in turn give them the confidence
and empowerment that they need for the future.</p>
<p>Empowered CHIJ KCP girls are those who have become the best versions of
themselves, with the power to pursue their own definitions of happiness
and success. This empowered self is one who is courageous and confident.
She is able to face her fears and step out of her comfort zone because
she believes that nothing can hold her back. She has a strong vision of
what she wants to achieve in her life and the lives of others. She is steeped
in a mindset of inquiry that always has a focus on the future.</p>
<p>Empowered CHIJ KCP girls also believe in the power of having a growth
mindset - everyone can learn anything, improve and achieve any goal with
effort and the right strategies. Through the setting of personal goals,
self – assessment and self – reflections, positive self – talk and a mindset
of gratitude, we hope to develop resilient girls who can adapt to any challenge.
Resilience is an important value in shaping the beliefs, attitudes and
actions of a child. A resilient student is adaptable, flexible and resourceful,
has good mutual social support, is able to cope with stressors positively,
is able to navigate change and ambiguity, has a “can do” attitude and a
sense of hope and purpose, and is confident to face challenges.</p>
<p><strong>SI 3 A Vibrant Learning Environment that enhances teaching and learning.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A Vibrant Learning Environment is created through the fostering of a stimulating school environment and a vibrant classroom environment.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Vibrant Learning Environment:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Place-Based Learning: A Multifaceted Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Place – Based Learning connects learning to students’ surroundings—the
buildings, the landscape while covering content and pedagogical goals and
building school and community pride.</p>
<p>Place-Based Education (PBE) is an approach to learning that takes advantage
of geography to create authentic, meaningful and engaging personalized
learning for students.</p>
<p>Place-Based Education enables student agency, boosts access and opportunity
and prioritizes deeper and more personalized learning.</p>
<p><strong>Vibrant Classroom Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>A vibrant classroom environment ensures pupil engagement through a conducive
environment for teaching and learning. In this environment, pupils develop
self – discipline during teaching and learning and have a great sense of
pride and ownership of their classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive Learners who embody the mission of CHIJ.</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s Strategic Objective 2 places a great emphasis on a values
– driven and inclusive culture where all are included and accepted. It
is this inclusivity that ensures that students enjoy coming to school,
are engaged in learning and are motivated to give their best.</p>
<p>An inclusive learner views others from a strength perspective – unique
individuals with specific talents, interests, and passion. They believe
that everyone has the potential to learn and shine regardless of their
differences. As examples of the mission of CHIJ, they aim to see the best
in each person and strive to include the disadvantaged, the last, lost
and least.</p>
<p>The following Strategic Initiatives enable the school to foster a CHRIST
– centered community where the mission of CHIJ can be achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SI 4 Community Student Leaders who actively contribute</strong>
</p>
<p>The focus of Student Leadership development in the school is based on
these main principles:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student CAN be developed as
a leader.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student SHOULD be developed
as a leader.</p>
<p>Leadership is no longer seen as the domain of a few who hold the expertise
or authority but is learnt and developed in all. The development and cultivation
of leadership competencies and dispositions in all our students is intentional
through customised programmes in the Total Curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through a three – tiered approach, students are provided with authentic
leadership opportunities and experiences that will provide them with the
knowledge, skills and values needed to navigate the current and future
world. Most importantly, as a CHIJ school, leadership development is values
– driven and aims to create girls who have a strong sense of service and
who are able to show care and compassion to those who are in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SI 5 CHIJ (KCP) Girls who have a sense of pride for school and nation.</strong>
</p>
<p>The identity of a CHIJ KCP girl is a strategic area needed to develop
women of grace and substance. The CHIJ KCP girl embodies the mission of
CHIJ in her pursuit for truth, justice, freedom and love. She is unique
in her care for anyone who is disadvantaged. It is this mission that gives
a CHIJ KCP girl her sense of pride not just as a CHIJ girl but as a citizen
of Singapore. This deep sense of pride will ensure that our girls have
a strong sense of belonging to school and country and will eventually motivate
them to play a contributory role to their school and community.</p>
<p><strong>SI 6 A CHRIST – centered community that embraces all.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>A Christ–centred Community believes in the worth and dignity of each person.
This inclusive community pays special reference to the needs of persons
who are disadvantaged in anyway and where the last, the least, and the
lost are welcomed and embraced. Every member of the community feels safe,
supported and loved, regardless of their differences, unique contexts and
backgrounds. It is a collaborative, integrated and interdependent community
where all give generously of themselves and receive likewise and where
the learning and well – being of all become a shared responsibility for
each member.</p>

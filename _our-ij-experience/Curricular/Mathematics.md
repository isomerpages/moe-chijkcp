<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<h4><strong><em>Vision: Towards a FUN Mathematics learning experience for our students</em></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>F</strong>oster the development of problem-solving skills</p>
<p><strong>U</strong>nderstand the connections between the world of Maths
and the broader world in which we live</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>urture a positive attitude and spirit of perseverance
in the pursuit of mathematical knowledge and skills</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department is dedicated to the goal of making the learning
of Mathematics meaningful by offering our students various platforms and
avenues to excel and improve in Maths.</p>
<p>Our instructional programme is aimed at building a strong foundation at
lower levels and reinforcing concepts at upper levels, guiding students
in problem-solving heuristics and addressing misconceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our teachers embrace the&nbsp;Growth mindset, and will patiently
guide our students to embrace challenges and see failures as an opportunity
to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The array of enrichment programmes are planned with the aim of offering
our students an opportunity to apply problem-solving strategies in everyday
situations so that they can appreciate its relevance in real-life scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our hope for our students is that they develop a positive attitude
towards the learning of Mathematics and find the subject relevant, interesting
and enjoyable. The challenge of solving a Mathematics problem is as desirable
as a competitive sport, and we want every child to experience that moment
of delight when they overcome a problem, which will motivate them to pursue
Mathematics as a hobby or a life-long profession.</p>
<p>A range of assessment modes are used to provide parents and teachers with
information and evidence of students’ progress in Mathematics. These assessment
modes include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance Tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journaling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self and Peer Assessment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Approach to Problem-Solving – The REAL Way</h4>
<p>The REAL approach is a problem-solving strategy that is based on the works
of George Polya, an influential mathematician whose ideas on how problems
can be solved, is widely used today. Polya identified these four basic
principles of problem solving:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devise a plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out the plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look back</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles are reflected in the REAL approach. The acronym is used
with the intention of helping our students remember the four principles
better.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Enrichment Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Maths Olympiad Coaching Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The coaching programme started in 2009 to groom students who display an
exceptional aptitude in competitive Mathematics. Members undergo training
for 1 to 2 terms to equip them with the problem solving skills needed for
rigorous mathematical Olympiads. Examples of Mathematics Olympiads students
will participate in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore Asian Schools Maths Olympiad (SASMO)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools - organized by Hwa Chong Institution
(SMOPS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore - organized by NUS High School
(NMOS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excellence 2000 (e2K)</strong>
</p>
<p>The e2K is an enrichment programme for Primary 4 to 6 students who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop our students’&nbsp;<strong>mathematical reasoning skills</strong>&nbsp;and
deepen their&nbsp;<strong>conceptual understanding</strong>&nbsp;through
an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with
their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, game and
mathematical explorations. The rich learning experiences offered by the
programme serve to help students develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions
mathematicians possess, and gain important 21st&nbsp;century competencies
such as critical thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>Maths Showcase</strong>
</p>
<p>As a post-PSLE activity, Primary 6 students will present Maths concepts
in a fun and engaging way to the Primary 1 and 2 students. The concepts
are presented in the form of challenges, puzzles and games and our Primary
6’s did a good job in facilitation, and everyone is clearly engaged and
enjoying their learning. This platform also gives our senior graduating
students a chance to bond and interact with their juniors.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Trail</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics trail is a stimulating experience for our students and
offers them an opportunity to solve mathematical problems while interacting
with her classmates within our school compound and at outdoor locations
such as the East Coast Park and Gardens by the Bay.</p>
<p>The activities emphasize relevant Mathematical skills such as estimation
and mental calculation. Students will also be able to relate some Science
and National Education concepts during the trail.</p>

<h3>Embracing a Growth Mindset at CHIJ (Katong) Primary</h3>
<h4>Our Vision:</h4>
<p><em>Our girls will be the best version of themselves, pursuing their own definitions of success with confidence, resilience and a Growth mindset.</em>
</p>
<p>We believe that every child can learn anything, improve and achieve any
goal with effort and the right strategies.</p>
<p>Our Growth Mindset initiative is anchored on our termly mantras, which
serve as powerful affirmations and reminders that inspires a culture of
positive reinforcement and encouragement to help our girls focus on perseverance
and overcoming challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a culture of growth mindset in a classroom involves intentional
efforts to foster a positive and resilient attitude towards learning and
challenges. The Growth Mindset concepts are infused in our curriculum through
the setting of personal goals, self-assessments and reflections. Our teachers
consciously acknowledge students for their progress and efforts and recognize
achievements, both big and small.</p>

<p>We encourage parents and caregivers to foster a Growth Mindset at home
by sharing information about the concepts with them through our termly
bulletins and anecdotes, videos and reflections in our SLS packages.</p>

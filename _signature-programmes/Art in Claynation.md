<p><strong><u>Art InCLAYnation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In May 2019, a group of 6 teachers embarked on a Ceramic-Making Course
taught by Mr Chua Soo Kim, a well-known Singapore ceramist.</p>
<p>Our school bought the relevant ceramic-making equipment and tools, including
a kiln to start this programme in 2020.</p>
<p>All teachers made ceramic mugs for their first lesson, while students
were introduced to ceramic-making at the various levels a year later.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Importance of Ceramics in Our School</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students get hands-on experience making objects/art out of simple clay.
They use 2 hand-building techniques, either pinching or slab construction
when creating their artwork.</p>
<p>We strive to give our students a chance to experience this form of 3D
art-form which can be difficult for them to experience at home.</p>
<p>The creative process in ceramic-making allows students to improve their
focus and reduce stress through the sense of touch, during the artmaking.</p>
<p>Our Art InCLAYnation programme covers 5 levels today. In 2024, our Primary
One and Two students will be introduced to ceramics, and they will make
a pencil holder and tile/coaster respectively using the hand-building techniques.&nbsp;
Primary Four students will be making small plates using hand-building (pinching
technique). Primary 5 and 6 students will be using hand-building (slab
construction technique) to create their ceramics.</p>

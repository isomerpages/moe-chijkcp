### Girls Like Tech

At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, no effort is spared in ensuring that our students are adequately prepared to adapt to the ever changing world and be future ready. Being future ready entails having a strong grounding and foundation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Our 'Girls Like Tech' programme is designed to promote intuitive and inquisitive experiences for our students through the use of technology. We strive to empower our students to undertake thoughtful risks and creative thought processes, engage in experiential learning, embrace collaboration, be resolute in problem-solving and ultimately deriving joy in learning.

#### Integrated STEM Curriculum


STEM education embarks on a common level topic which integrates different subjects. Learning is brought beyond the textbooks and focuses on the hands-on application of knowledge. Lessons are brought ALIVE through the incorporation of ICT tools and equipment such as Strawbees, Spheros and Kamibots.

#### Fun Exploratory Activities during recess


Students engage in fun and exploratory science-based play which requires analyzing, investigating and generating activities. The enrichment activities are an extension of the Science Curriculum designed by the Science teachers.

#### Coding during CCA


Students are taught the fundamentals of coding during their CCA sessions. After which, they are required to think of a practical solution to the problems that they observe commonly around the school. Apart from learning about hardware and software, they also apply the concepts in solving authentic problems.

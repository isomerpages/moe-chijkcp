<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides meaningful and purposeful
age-appropriate opportunities for real-life application of learning. It
allows for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning, providing
opportunities for holistic development. It helps students appreciate the
relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum
and encourages students to creatively apply knowledge and skills to practical
problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Tier 1 programmes are conducted for all students.</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture our students to be Competent, Confident and Respectful Communicators,
we adopt a spiral approach, beginning in Primary One.</p>
<p>In English Language (EL), students begin by speaking as a group using
a prepared memorised script, and gradually learn to speak individually
and think on their feet. In the programmes, students are taught skills
to build up their competency and given speaking opportunities to build
up their confidence in facing an audience. Students are also taught to
communicate in a respectful manner.</p>
<p>The following programmes are conducted:</p>
<p>P1: Speech and Drama; ALP Lessons; Talent Showcase</p>
<p>P2: Speech and Drama; ALP Lessons; Talent Showcase</p>
<p>P3 &amp; P4: ALP Lessons</p>
<p>P5: ALP Lessons / Content Creation (Canva)\</p>

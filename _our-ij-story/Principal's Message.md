<p>2025 will be an exciting year for CHIJ (Katong) Primary. Together with
CHIJ Katong Convent, our schools will be celebrating 95 years of CHIJ education.</p>
<p>This year our school theme is Love Never Fails (1 Corinthians 13:4, 8).</p>
<p>Here is the verse in its’ entirety:</p>
<p><em>4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</em>
</p>
<p><em>5 It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.</em>
</p>
<p><em>6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</em>
</p>
<p><em>7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>8 Love never fails.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for our school in 2025?</strong>
</p>
<p>CHIJ schools are dedicated to creating a Christ-centered community that
promotes truth, justice, freedom, and love, with a special focus on supporting
those who are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>This mission emphasizes the importance of love as a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The CHIJ school motto, "Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty," reflects
the commitment to nurturing students who embody simplicity, virtue, and
unwavering dedication, encouraging our girls to lead lives grounded in
love, compassion, patience, humility and kindness.</p>
<p>And these will be our success criteria for 2025 and beyond. We will continue
to prepare our girls for an uncertain and challenging future by teaching
them adaptive, innovative and critical thinking. We will also develop them
in social – emotional skills so that they can be empowered young women
who are confident, resilient and strong. But most important, we will teach
them to use their talents and strengths to be a beacon of light for others,
especially the disadvantaged – to show others that love truly never fails.</p>
<p>That is the mark of a CHIJ school, and of our school.</p>
<p>Our parents play a very important role in making our dreams for our girls
a reality. Let’s work together to develop girls who have grace and substance.
It will take time, as our girls are growing and finding their way. But
we will be their guiding light when they are lost, when they falter, when
they make mistakes. Like our theme, we will try our best to show them love,
patience and kindness too.</p>
<p>Here's to a blessed 2025 for our school, and for all of you.</p>
<p>Mrs. Simon</p>
<p>Principal, CHIJ (Katong) Primary</p>

<p>2026 will be an exciting year for CHIJ (Katong) Primary! Each year, we
have a theme that guides us in our thought, word, and deed.</p>
<p>This year, our theme is <strong><em>“Strong as One: Every Voice Matters; Every Gift Strengthens.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>When we are strong as ONE person, we:</em></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Are strong and Brave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are confident and resilient</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand up for what is right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use our unique strengths and gifts to make a positive difference</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>When we are strong as ONE school, we:</em></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Grow stronger when we help and learn from each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are never alone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are stronger when our unique strengths and differences are combined</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>‘Strong as One’ reminds us of our CHIJ motto, which is to be ‘Simple In
Virtue, Steadfast in Duty.’ It is an important theme that focuses on confidence,
empowerment, and advocacy for the disadvantaged – the essence of an IJ
girl. We hope that our girls learn and grow to be confident, courageous,
but more important, kind, compassionate – beacons of light to those who
are struggling.</p>
<p>As a Catholic school, ‘Strong as One’ reminds us to always trust in God’s
providence. We need not be afraid, discouraged, or troubled because God
is always with us. Our founder, Blessed Nicolas Barre also tells us – <strong><em>“never be discouraged when the good you do meets with opposition. God’s work always bears fruit in HIS time.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Father Barre reminds us that what appears to destroy us can, in truth,
become the very source of our strength. When trials come, they strip away
what is superficial and fragile, revealing the core of our faith and courage.
Like gold refined by fire, adversity purifies us, forging a resilient spirit
grounded in trust and hope. It is not the absence of hardship that marks
the blessed, but the faithful endurance of it with love and perseverance.
Father Barre’s words echo across time to encourage us: the very challenges
meant to destroy us are those that will deepen our compassion, and embolden
our mission.</p>
<p>Let us work together, parents and school to teach our girls to embrace
every trial with courage, knowing that in God’s providence, nothing is
wasted. Each difficulty is a hidden blessing, preparing them to be beacons
of peace, hope and love for the world.</p>
<p>Here’s to a blessed 2026 for our school, for our teachers and girls, and
for your families.</p>

<p>Principal, CHIJ (Katong) Primary</p>

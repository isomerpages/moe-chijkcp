<p>2025 will be an exciting year for CHIJ (Katong) Primary. Together with
CHIJ Katong Convent, our schools will be celebrating 95 years of CHIJ education.</p>
<p>This year our school theme is Love Never Fails (1 Corinthians 13:4, 8).</p>
<p>Here is the verse in itsâ€™ entirety:</p>
<p><em>4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</em>
</p>
<p><em>5 It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.</em>
</p>
<p><em>6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</em>
</p>
<p><em>7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>8 Love never fails.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>Our Primary 5 students traded their classrooms for the great outdoors
during their Adventure Camp held from 5 to 7 February 2026 at the MOE Changi
Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. As a class, they embraced the
outdoor experience, taking part in a range of activities that challenged
them both physically and mentally. Living together in dormitories, sleeping
in sleeping bags, and sharing meals strengthened friendships and built
class camaraderie.</p>
<p>Students tackled high-element activities such as the tower circuit, zipline,
abseiling, and rock wall climbing, where they learned to overcome their
fears and persevere. They also performed as a class during the campfire,
a highlight of the camp. Many students stepped out of their comfort zones,
demonstrating resilience and a growth mindset throughout the experience.</p>
<p>Overall, students shared that they had a meaningful and enjoyable time
bonding with their classmates and teachers through this challenging outdoor
adventure. It was a great and memorable start to the year at a new level,
with new friendships forged and confidence strengthened.</p>

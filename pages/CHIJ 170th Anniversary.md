<h4>CHIJ 170th Anniversary Celebration</h4>
<p>The CHIJ (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus) 170th Anniversary celebration
marks a significant milestone for the institution this year, which has
a long history of providing education and nurturing young women and girls.
This anniversary’s main event was Founder’s Day celebration with a combine
school Mass celebrated by Cardinal William Goh, the Archbishop of Singapore.
The event took place at the National Stadium, filled with students, alumni,
staff, and supporters of the CHIJ schools, celebrating the legacy of the
institution with singing and prayers.</p>
<p>During the speech by our IJ Board Chairperson, Vivienne Lim, she emphasized
that CHIJ schools were established by the Infant Jesus Sisters in 1854
in Singapore and have since played an important role in the education of
girls across the nation. The schools focus not only on academic excellence
but also on moral and spiritual growth, in line with Catholic values.</p>
<p>This 170th anniversary was indeed a momentous occasion for CHIJ Katong
Primary where students, staff and parents come together to celebrate the
institution's contributions to education and society over the years.</p>

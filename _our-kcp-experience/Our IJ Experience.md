<p>At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, we are deeply proud to be part of the esteemed
CHIJ fraternity. Our rich heritage and time-honoured traditions form a
strong connection and foundation for everything we do, shaping the values
we instill in our students and helping them forge a profound sense of belonging,
not just to their school, but to the broader CHIJ family.</p>
<p>Our students are encouraged to see themselves as part of something larger
- a shared identity that spans all CHIJ schools. We nurture this sense
of connection through symbols, meanings, and events that are present in
every CHIJ school. These common features unite us, creating a powerful
and close-knit bond that stretches across generations of CHIJ girls. To
ensure that this bond is more than just a passing association, we have
specially curated programmes and activities that form the cornerstone of
our effort to help our students understand and live out the values that
define the CHIJ spirit. It's more than just planned programmes and activities;
it's a way for our students to connect deeply with the legacy of the CHIJ
family.</p>
<p>As a CHIJ (Katong) Primary pupil, every girl is anchored in the strong
foundation of our school's values, rooted firmly in the love of God and
the teachings of the Catholic Church. She is reminded daily that she is
loved by God, a belief that shapes her heart and mind. Central to this
faith are the Catholic Social Teachings, which emphasize the inherent dignity
of every human being, the importance of the common good, and the value
of each person. These teachings are not abstract ideals - they are principles
that guide our students' actions, helping them become compassionate, thoughtful,
and responsible individuals.</p>
<p>We believe that the heart of a truly successful education goes beyond
academic achievement. It lies in nurturing students who understand the
importance of truth, justice, freedom, and love. By working synergistically,
our students build an IJ community that is strong, united, and committed
to making a positive difference in the world. We aspire to see our students
emerge as leaders who are not only academically capable but also deeply
rooted in values that reflect the very best of the CHIJ tradition.</p>
<p>We provide our students with the tools to carry forward the legacy of
CHIJ, ensuring that they are empowered to become agents of change, champions
of justice, and ambassadors of love in the world.</p>

<h3>Embracing a Growth Mindset at CHIJ (Katong) Primary</h3>
<h4>Our Vision:</h4>
<p><em>Our girls will be the best version of themselves, pursuing their own definitions of success with confidence, resilience and a Growth mindset.</em>
</p>
<p>We believe that every child can learn anything, improve and achieve any
goal with effort and the right strategies.</p>
<p>Our Growth Mindset initiative is anchored on our termly mantras, which
serve as powerful affirmations and reminders that inspires a culture of
positive reinforcement and encouragement to help our girls focus on perseverance
and overcoming challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a culture of growth mindset in a classroom involves intentional
efforts to foster a positive and resilient attitude towards learning and
challenges. The Growth Mindset concepts are infused in our curriculum through
the setting of personal goals, self-assessments and reflections. Our teachers
consciously acknowledge students for their progress and efforts and recognize
achievements, both big and small.</p>

<p>We encourage parents and caregivers to foster a Growth Mindset at home
by sharing information about the concepts with them through our termly
bulletins and anecdotes, videos and reflections in our SLS packages.</p>

<p><strong>Garden of Dreams Journal</strong>
</p>
<p>The Garden of Dreams Journal is an inhouse-project designed to promote
the Growth Mindset in our students so that they may grow to be positive,
resilient, and confident girls. By engaging in the various activities and
prompts in the journal, students will have opportunity to explore their
dreams, set goals and track their progress. Through this process, we hope
to empower them to recognise their abilities and strengths, overcome obstacles
and cultivate resilience. Presently, the journal is available for our Primary
2 and 3 students and will eventually be rolled out to the whole school
in time to come.</p>

<h2>Enabling Digital Learners for Future Learning</h2>
<p>At CHIJ (Katong) Primary, no effort is spared in ensuring that our students
are adequately prepared to adapt to the ever changing world and be future
ready. Being future ready entails having a strong grounding and foundation
in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Our
'Girls Like Tech' programme is designed to promote intuitive and inquisitive
experiences for our students through the use of technology. We strive to
empower our students to undertake thoughtful risks and creative thought
processes, engage in experiential learning, embrace collaboration, be resolute
in problem-solving and ultimately deriving joy in learning.</p>
<h4>Integrated STEM Curriculum</h4>
<p>STEM education embarks on a common level topic which integrates different
subjects. Learning is brought beyond the textbooks and focuses on the hands-on
application of knowledge. Lessons are brought ALIVE through the incorporation
of ICT tools and equipment such as Strawbees, Spheros and Kamibots.</p>
<h4>Fun Exploratory Activities during recess</h4>
<p>Students engage in fun and exploratory science-based play which requires
analyzing, investigating and generating activities. The enrichment activities
are an extension of the Science Curriculum designed by the Science teachers.</p>

<h4>Coding during CCA</h4>
<p>Students are taught the fundamentals of coding during their CCA sessions.
After which, they are required to think of a practical solution to the
problems that they observe commonly around the school. Apart from learning
about hardware and software, they also apply the concepts in solving authentic
problems.</p>

<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides meaningful and purposeful
age-appropriate opportunities for real-life application of learning. It
allows for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning, providing
opportunities for holistic development. It helps students appreciate the
relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum
and encourages students to creatively apply knowledge and skills to practical
problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Tier 1 programmes are conducted for all students.</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture our students to be Competent, Confident and Respectful Communicators,
we adopt a spiral approach, beginning in Primary One.</p>
<p>In English Language (EL), students begin by speaking as a group using
a prepared memorised script, and gradually learn to speak individually
and think on their feet. In the programmes, students are taught skills
to build up their competency and given speaking opportunities to build
up their confidence in facing an audience. Students are also taught to
communicate in a respectful manner.</p>
<p>The following programmes are conducted:</p>
<p>P1: Choral Recitation; Picture Talk; Talent Showcase</p>
<p>P2: Readers' Theatre; Pick-and-Tell; Talent Showcase</p>
<p>P3: Story-telling</p>
<p>P4: Public Speaking</p>
<p>P5: Sales Pitch; Debate</p>

<p>In Mother-Tongue Language (MTL), students learn to interact and converse
with their friends using guided sentence structures aligned to the MTL
curriculum. As they move into the middle and upper levels, students are
exposed to graphic stimuli such as pictures, video clips and news articles
(current affairs) and they are taught to express their opinions and feelings.
Along the way, there is scaffolding using sentence starters and thinking
processes which allow them to think through the content before presentation.
The department incorporates technology into the ALP programme through ICT
tools like ClassPoint, Canva and Flipgrid, which allow students to present
in varied modes, hence promoting the Joy of Learning. Similarly, they are
taught to be respectful communicators (good listeners and confident speakers).</p>
<p>The following programmes are conducted:</p>
<p>P1: Speech and Drama; ALP Lessons; Talent Showcase</p>
<p>P2: Speech and Drama; ALP Lessons; Talent Showcase</p>

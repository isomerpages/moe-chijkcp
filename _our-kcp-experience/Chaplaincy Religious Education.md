<h3>Deepening Our Faith</h3>
<h4>Religious Education in School</h4>
<p>In our school, the Catholic Identity is evident in the practice and knowledge
of the Catholic faith through all parts of the school day. Prayers and
hymns singing are led by staff and students daily.</p>
<p>The Catholic students also take part in school activities such as annual
retreats, attend Family Masses and Parent and Child Activities. Rosary
devotions and Lent Activities are conducted for Catholic students to help
them deepen their faith.</p>

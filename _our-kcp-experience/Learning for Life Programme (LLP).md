<h2>Serve with Love</h2>
<p>Our School is a Christ-centred school community where all work together
for the promotion of truth, justice, freedom and love, with special reference
to the needs of persons who are disadvantaged in any way. Aligned to our
School Mission, the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on Community
Student Leadership and the development of an Inclusive Community that believes
in the worth and dignity of each person.</p>
<p>The LLP is targeted at all students to develop a range of self-management
and leadership skills through a structured and progressive Student Leadership
Curriculum from Primary 1 to Primary 6. Based on Kouzes' and Posner's leadership
model, the school engages students in the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership,
namely; ‘Model the Way’, ‘Inspire a Shared Vision’, ‘Challenge the Process’,
‘Enable Others to Act’ and ‘Encourage the Heart’. Students learn more about
themselves and community leadership to build the foundation for active
citizenship as Community Student Leaders.</p>
<p>The programme provides opportunities for students to use their talents
and strengths to serve the community, especially the last, least and lost.
It value-adds to the quality of school experience as students apply the
skills learnt in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Photographs and more information of the programme can be found on the
School’s Facebook page.</p>

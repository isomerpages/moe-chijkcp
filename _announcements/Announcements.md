#### CHIJ 170th Anniversary Celebration 


The community of CHIJ Schools will be celebrating its 170th Anniversary this year and the theme is “Hold On To Our IJ Dream”.  This event commemorates the 170 years of the IJ mission in Singapore.

As part of the 170th Anniversary Celebrations, all CHIJ Schools will have activities designed to commemorate this significant year. The highlight of our celebrations will be the gathering of the entire CHIJ community at the Singapore Sports Hub on Monday 20th May 2024 (9am – 12pm). Here, we will come together to honour our unique IJ identity and legacy, offering our heartfelt gratitude to God for His enduring mercy and blessings. We are delighted to share that His Eminence, William Cardinal Goh, will grace us with his presence and will also be the main celebrant at the celebration.

CHIJ KC alumni, past students and former staff who wish to join in the celebration may put in your request via the [FormSG](https://form.gov.sg/65f90d43ff96e4057a667704) .

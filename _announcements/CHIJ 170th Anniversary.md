<h4>CHIJ 170th Anniversary Celebration</h4>
<p>The community of CHIJ Schools will be celebrating its 170th Anniversary
this year and the theme is “Hold On To Our IJ Dream”. This event commemorates
the 170 years of the IJ mission in Singapore.</p>
<p>As part of the 170th Anniversary Celebrations, all CHIJ Schools will have
activities designed to commemorate this significant year. The highlight
of our celebrations will be the gathering of the entire CHIJ community
at the Singapore Sports Hub on Monday 20th May 2024 (9am – 12pm). Here,
we will come together to honour our unique IJ identity and legacy, offering
our heartfelt gratitude to God for His enduring mercy and blessings. We
are delighted to share that His Eminence, William Cardinal Goh, will grace
us with his presence and will also be the main celebrant at the celebration.</p>
